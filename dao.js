  'Stephen Mitchell': [
    'The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao, the name that can be named is not the eternal Name. The unnamable is the eternally real. Naming is the origin of all material things. Free from desire, you realize the mystery. Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations. Yet mystery and manifestations arise from the same source. This source is called darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gateway to all understanding.',
    'When people see some things as beautiful, other things become ugly. When people see some things as good, other things become bad. Being and non-being create each other. Difficult and easy support each other. Long and short define each other. High and low depend on each other. Before and after follow each other. Therefore the Master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything. Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go. She has but doesn\'t possess, acts but doesn\'t expect. When her work is done, she forgets it. That is why it lasts forever.',
    'If you overesteem great men, people become powerless. If you overvalue possessions, people begin to steal. The Master leads by emptying people\'s minds and filling their cores, by weakening their ambition and toughening their resolve. He helps people lose everything they know, everything they desire, and creates confusion in those who think that they know. Practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place.',
    'The Tao is like a well: used but never used up. It is like the eternal void: filled with infinite possibilities. It is hidden but always present. I don\'t know who gave birth to it. It is older than God.',
    'The Tao doesn\'t take sides; it gives birth to both good and evil. The Master doesn\'t take sides; she welcomes both saints and sinners. The Tao is like a bellows: it is empty yet infinitely capable. The more you use it, the more it produces; the more you talk of it, the less you understand. Hold on to the center.',
    'The Tao is called the Great Mother: empty yet inexhaustible, it gives birth to infinite worlds. It is always present within you. You can use it any way you want.',
    'The Tao is infinite, eternal. Why is it eternal? It was never born; thus it can never die. Why is it infinite? It has no desires for itself; thus it is present for all beings. The Master stays behind; that is why she is ahead. She is detached from all things; that is why she is one with them. Because she has let go of herself, she is perfectly fulfilled.',
    'The supreme good is like water, which nourishes all things without trying to. It is content with the low places that people disdain. Thus it is like the Tao. In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don\'t try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present. When you are content to be simply yourself and don\'t compare or compete, everybody will respect you.',
    'Fill your bowl to the brim and it will spill. Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt. Chase after money and security and your heart will never unclench. Care about people\'s approval and you will be their prisoner. Do your work, then step back. The only path to serenity.',
    'Can you coax your mind from its wandering and keep to the original oneness? Can you let your body become supple as a newborn child\'s? Can you cleanse your inner vision until you see nothing but the light? Can you love people and lead them without imposing your will? Can you deal with the most vital matters by letting events take their course? Can you step back from you own mind and thus understand all things? Giving birth and nourishing, having without possessing, acting with no expectations, leading and not trying to control: this is the supreme virtue.',
    'We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move. We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want. We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable. We work with being, but non-being is what we use.',
    'Colors blind the eye. Sounds deafen the ear. Flavors numb the taste. Thoughts weaken the mind. Desires wither the heart. The Master observes the world but trusts his inner vision. He allows things to come and go. His heart is open as the sky.',
    'Success is as dangerous as failure. Hope is as hollow as fear. What does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure? Whether you go up the ladder or down it, your position is shaky. When you stand with your two feet on the ground, you will always keep your balance. What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear? Hope and fear are both phantoms that arise from thinking of the self. When we don\'t see the self as self, what do we have to fear? See the world as your self. Have faith in the way things are. Love the world as your self; then you can care for all things.',
    'Look, and it can\'t be seen. Listen, and it can\'t be heard. Reach, and it can\'t be grasped. Above, it isn\'t bright. Below, it isn\'t dark. Seamless, unnamable, it returns to the realm of nothing. Form that includes all forms, image without an image, subtle, beyond all conception. Approach it and there is no beginning; follow it and there is no end. You can\'t know it, but you can be it, at ease in your own life. Just realize where you come from: this is the essence of wisdom.',
    'The ancient Masters were profound and subtle. Their wisdom was unfathomable. There is no way to describe it; all we can describe is their appearance. They were careful as someone crossing an iced-over stream. Alert as a warrior in enemy territory. Courteous as a guest. Fluid as melting ice. Shapable as a block of wood. Receptive as a valley. Clear as a glass of water. Do you have the patience to wait till your mud settles and the water is clear? Can you remain unmoving till the right action arises by itself? The Master doesn\'t seek fulfillment. Not seeking, not expecting, she is present, and can welcome all things.',
    'Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return. Each separate being in the universe returns to the common source. Returning to the source is serenity. If you don\'t realize the source, you stumble in confusion and sorrow. When you realize where you come from, you naturally become tolerant, disinterested, amused, kindhearted as a grandmother, dignified as a king. Immersed in the wonder of the Tao, you can deal with whatever life brings you, and when death comes, you are ready.',
    'When the Master governs, the people are hardly aware that he exists. Next best is a leader who is loved. Next, one who is feared. The worst is one who is despised. If you don\'t trust the people, you make them untrustworthy. The Master doesn\'t talk, he acts. When his work is done, the people say, "Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!"',
    'When the great Tao is forgotten, goodness and piety appear. When the body\'s intelligence declines, cleverness and knowledge step forth. When there is no peace in the family, filial piety begins. When the country falls into chaos, patriotism is born.',
    'Throw away holiness and wisdom, and people will be a hundred times happier. Throw away morality and justice, and people will do the right thing. Throw away industry and profit, and there won\'t be any thieves. If these three aren\'t enough, just stay at the center of the circle and let all things take their course.',
    'Stop thinking, and end your problems. What difference between yes and no? What difference between success and failure? Must you value what others value, avoid what others avoid? How ridiculous! Other people are excited, as though they were at a parade. I alone don\'t care, I alone am expressionless, like an infant before it can smile. Other people have what they need; I alone possess nothing. I alone drift about, like someone without a home. I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty. Other people are bright; I alone am dark. Other people are sharper; I alone am dull. Other people have a purpose; I alone don\'t know. I drift like a wave on the ocean, I blow as aimless as the wind. I am different from ordinary people. I drink from the Great Mother\'s breasts.',
    'The Master keeps her mind always at one with the Tao; that is what gives her her radiance. The Tao is ungraspable. How can her mind be at one with it? Because she doesn\'t cling to ideas. The Tao is dark and unfathomable. How can it make her radiant? Because she lets it. Since before time and space were, the Tao is. It is beyond is and is not. How do I know this is true? I look inside myself and see.',
    'If you want to become whole, let yourself be partial. If you want to become straight, let yourself be crooked. If you want to become full, let yourself be empty. If you want to be reborn, let yourself die. If you want to be given everything, give everything up. The Master, by residing in the Tao, sets an example for all beings. Because he doesn\'t display himself, people can see his light. Because he has nothing to prove, people can trust his words. Because he doesn\'t know who he is, people recognize themselves in him. Because he has no goal in mind, everything he does succeeds. When the ancient Masters said, "If you want to be given everything, give everything up," they weren\'t using empty phrases. Only in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself.',
    'Express yourself completely, then keep quiet. Be like the forces of nature: when it blows, there is only wind; when it rains, there is only rain; when the clouds pass, the sun shines through. If you open yourself to the Tao, you are at one with the Tao and you can embody it completely. If you open yourself to insight, you are at one with insight and you can use it completely. If you open yourself to loss, you are at one with loss and you can accept it completely. Open yourself to the Tao, then trust your natural responses; and everything will fall into place.',
    'He who stands on tiptoe doesn\'t stand firm. He who rushes ahead doesn\'t go far. He who tries to shine dims his own light. He who defines himself can\'t know who he really is. He who has power over others can\'t empower himself. He who clings to his work will create nothing that endures. If you want to accord with the Tao, just do your job, then let go.',
    'There was something formless and perfect before the universe was born. It is serene. Empty. Solitary. Unchanging. Infinite. Eternally present. It is the mother of the universe. For lack of a better name, I call it the Tao. It flows through all things, inside and outside, and returns to the origin of all things. The Tao is great. The universe is great. Earth is great. Man is great. These are the four great powers. Man follows the earth. Earth follows the universe. The universe follows the Tao. The Tao follows only itself.',
    'The heavy is the root of the light. The unmoved is the source of all movement. Thus the Master travels all day without leaving home. However splendid the views, she stays serenely in herself. Why should the lord of the country flit about like a fool? If you let yourself be blown to and fro, you lose touch with your root. If you let restlessness move you, you lose touch with who you are.',
    'A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving. A good artist lets his intuition lead him wherever it wants. A good scientist has freed himself of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is. Thus the Master is available to all people and doesn\'t reject anyone. He is ready to use all situations and doesn\'t waste anything. This is called embodying the light. What is a good man but a bad man\'s teacher? What is a bad man but a good man\'s job? If you don\'t understand this, you will get lost, however intelligent you are. It is the great secret.',
    'Know the male, yet keep to the female: receive the world in your arms. If you receive the world, the Tao will never leave you and you will be like a little child. Know the white, yet keep to the black: be a pattern for the world. If you are a pattern for the world, the Tao will be strong inside you and there will be nothing you can\'t do. Know the personal, yet keep to the impersonal: accept the world as it is. If you accept the world, the Tao will be luminous inside you and you will return to your primal self. The world is formed from the void, like utensils from a block of wood. The Master knows the utensils, yet keeps to the the block: thus she can use all things.',
    'Do you want to improve the world? I don\'t think it can be done. The world is sacred. It can\'t be improved. If you tamper with it, you\'ll ruin it. If you treat it like an object, you\'ll lose it. There is a time for being ahead, a time for being behind; a time for being in motion, a time for being at rest; a time for being vigorous, a time for being exhausted; a time for being safe, a time for being in danger. The Master sees things as they are, without trying to control them. She lets them go their own way, and resides at the center of the circle.',
    'Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men doesn\'t try to force issues or defeat enemies by force of arms. For every force there is a counterforce. Violence, even well intentioned, always rebounds upon oneself. The Master does his job and then stops. He understands that the universe is forever out of control, and that trying to dominate events goes against the current of the Tao. Because he believes in himself, he doesn\'t try to convince others. Because he is content with himself, he doesn\'t need others\' approval. Because he accepts himself, the whole world accepts him.',
    'Weapons are the tools of violence; all decent men detest them. Weapons are the tools of fear; a decent man will avoid them except in the direst necessity and, if compelled, will use them only with the utmost restraint. Peace is his highest value. If the peace has been shattered, how can he be content? His enemies are not demons, but human beings like himself. He doesn\'t wish them personal harm. Nor does he rejoice in victory. How could he rejoice in victory and delight in the slaughter of men? He enters a battle gravely, with sorrow and with great compassion, as if he were attending a funeral.',
    'The Tao can\'t be perceived. Smaller than an electron, it contains uncountable galaxies. If powerful men and women could remain centered in the Tao, all things would be in harmony. The world would become a paradise. All people would be at peace, and the law would be written in their hearts. When you have names and forms, know that they are provisional. When you have institutions, know where their functions should end. Knowing when to stop, you can avoid any danger. All things end in the Tao as rivers flow into the sea.',
    'Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich. If you stay in the center and embrace death with your whole heart, you will endure forever.',
    'The great Tao flows everywhere. All things are born from it, yet it doesn\'t create them. It pours itself into its work, yet it makes no claim. It nourishes infinite worlds, yet it doesn\'t hold on to them. Since it is merged with all things and hidden in their hearts, it can be called humble. Since all things vanish into it and it alone endures, it can be called great. It isn\'t aware of its greatness; thus it is truly great.',
    'She who is centered in the Tao can go where she wishes, without danger. She perceives the universal harmony, even amid great pain, because she has found peace in her heart. Music or the smell of good cooking may make people stop and enjoy. But words that point to the Tao seem monotonous and without flavor. When you look for it, there is nothing to see. When you listen for it, there is nothing to hear. When you use it, it is inexhaustible.',
    'If you want to shrink something, you must first allow it to expand. If you want to get rid of something, you must first allow it to flourish. If you want to take something, you must first allow it to be given. This is called the subtle perception of the way things are. The soft overcomes the hard. The slow overcomes the fast. Let your workings remain a mystery. Just show people the results.',
    'The Tao never does anything, yet through it all things are done. If powerful men and women could center themselves in it, the whole world would be transformed by itself, in its natural rhythms. People would be content with their simple, everyday lives, in harmony, and free of desire. When there is no desire, all things are at peace.',
    'The Master doesn\'t try to be powerful; thus he is truly powerful. The ordinary man keeps reaching for power; thus he never has enough. The Master does nothing, yet he leaves nothing undone. The ordinary man is always doing things, yet many more are left to be done. The kind man does something, yet something remains undone. The just man does something, and leaves many things to be done. The moral man does something, and when no one responds he rolls up his sleeves and uses force. When the Tao is lost, there is goodness. When goodness is lost, there is morality. When morality is lost, there is ritual. Ritual is the husk of true faith, the beginning of chaos. Therefore the Master concerns himself with the depths and not the surface, with the fruit and not the flower. He has no will of his own. He dwells in reality, and lets all illusions go.',
    'In harmony with the Tao, the sky is clear and spacious, the earth is solid and full, all creatures flourish together, content with the way they are, endlessly repeating themselves, endlessly renewed. When man interferes with the Tao, the sky becomes filthy, the earth becomes depleted, the equilibrium crumbles, creatures become extinct. The Master views the parts with compassion, because he understands the whole. His constant practice is humility. He doesn\'t glitter like a jewel but lets himself be shaped by the Tao, as rugged and common as stone.',
    'Return is the movement of the Tao. Yielding is the way of the Tao. All things are born of being. Being is born of non-being.',
    'When a superior man hears of the Tao, he immediately begins to embody it. When an average man hears of the Tao, he half believes it, half doubts it. When a foolish man hears of the Tao, he laughs out loud. If he didn\'t laugh, it wouldn\'t be the Tao. Thus it is said: The path into the light seems dark, the path forward seems to go back, the direct path seems long, true power seems weak, true purity seems tarnished, true steadfastness seems changeable, true clarity seems obscure, the greatest are seems unsophisticated, the greatest love seems indifferent, the greatest wisdom seems childish. The Tao is nowhere to be found. Yet it nourishes and completes all things.',
    'The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two. Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to all things. All things have their backs to the female and stand facing the male. When male and female combine, all things achieve harmony. Ordinary men hate solitude. But the Master makes use of it, embracing his aloneness, realizing he is one with the whole universe.',
    'The gentlest thing in the world overcomes the hardest thing in the world. That which has no substance enters where there is no space. This shows the value of non-action. Teaching without words, performing without actions: that is the Master\'s way.',
    'Fame or integrity: which is more important? Money or happiness: which is more valuable? Success or failure: which is more destructive? If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never truly be fulfilled. If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself. Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.',
    'True perfection seems imperfect, yet it is perfectly itself. True fullness seems empty, yet it is fully present. True straightness seems crooked. True wisdom seems foolish. True art seems artless. The Master allows things to happen. She shapes events as they come. She steps out of the way and lets the Tao speak for itself.',
    'When a country is in harmony with the Tao, the factories make trucks and tractors. When a country goes counter to the Tao, warheads are stockpiled outside the cities. There is no greater illusion than fear, no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself, no greater misfortune than having an enemy. Whoever can see through all fear will always be safe.',
    'Without opening your door, you can open your heart to the world. Without looking out your window, you can see the essence of the Tao. The more you know, the less you understand. The Master arrives without leaving, sees the light without looking, achieves without doing a thing.',
    'In pursuit of knowledge, every day something is added. In the practice of the Tao, every day something is dropped. Less and less do you need to force things, until finally you arrive at non-action. When nothing is done, nothing is left undone. True mastery can be gained by letting things go their own way. It can\'t be gained by interfering.',
    'The Master has no mind of her own. She works with the mind of the people. She is good to people who are good. She is also good to people who aren\'t good. This is true goodness. She trusts people who are trustworthy. She also trusts people who aren\'t trustworthy. This is true trust. The Master\'s mind is like space. People don\'t understand her. They look to her and wait. She treats them like her own children.',
    'The Master gives himself up to whatever the moment brings. He knows that he is going to die, and he has nothing left to hold on to: no illusions in his mind, no resistances in his body. He doesn\'t think about his actions; they flow from the core of his being. He holds nothing back from life; therefore he is ready for death, as a man is ready for sleep after a good day\'s work.',
    'Every being in the universe is an expression of the Tao. It springs into existence, unconscious, perfect, free, takes on a physical body, lets circumstances complete it. That is why every being spontaneously honors the Tao. The Tao gives birth to all beings, nourishes them, maintains them, cares for them, comforts them, protects them, takes them back to itself, creating without possessing, acting without expecting, guiding without interfering. That is why love of the Tao is in the very nature of things.',
    'In the beginning was the Tao. All things issue from it; all things return to it. To find the origin, trace back the manifestations. When you recognize the children and find the mother, you will be free of sorrow. If you close your mind in judgements and traffic with desires, your heart will be troubled. If you keep your mind from judging and aren\'t led by the senses, your heart will find peace. Seeing into darkness is clarity. Knowing how to yield is strength. Use your own light and return to the source of light. This is called practicing eternity.',
    'The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths. Be aware when things are out of balance. Stay centered within the Tao. When rich speculators prosper While farmers lose their land; when government officials spend money on weapons instead of cures; when the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible while the poor have nowhere to turn- all this is robbery and chaos. It is not in keeping with the Tao.',
    'Whoever is planted in the Tao will not be rooted up. Whoever embraces the Tao will not slip away. Her name will be held in honor from generation to generation. Let the Tao be present in your life and you will become genuine. Let it be present in your family and your family will flourish. Let it be present in your country and your country will be an example to all countries in the world. Let it be present in the universe and the universe will sing. How do I know this is true? By looking inside myself.',
    'He who is in harmony with the Tao is like a newborn child. Its bones are soft, its muscles are weak, but its grip is powerful. It doesn\'t know about the union of male and female, yet its penis can stand erect, so intense is its vital power. It can scream its head off all day, yet it never becomes hoarse, so complete is its harmony. The Master\'s power is like this. He lets all things come and go effortlessly, without desire. He never expects results; thus he is never disappointed. He is never disappointed; thus his spirit never grows old.',
    'Those who know don\'t talk. Those who talk don\'t know. Close your mouth, block off your senses, blunt your sharpness, untie your knots, soften your glare, settle your dust. This is the primal identity. Be like the Tao. It can\'t be approached or withdrawn from, benefited or harmed, honored or brought into disgrace. It gives itself up continually. That is why it endures.',
    'If you want to be a great leader, you must learn to follow the Tao. Stop trying to control. Let go of fixed plans and concepts, and the world will govern itself. The more prohibitions you have, the less virtuous people will be. The more weapons you have, the less secure people will be. The more subsidies you have, the less self-reliant people will be. Therefore the Master says: I let go of the law, and people become honest. I let go of economics, and people become prosperous. I let go of religion, and people become serene. I let go of all desire for the common good, and the good becomes common as grass.',
    'If a country is governed with tolerance, the people are comfortable and honest. If a country is governed with repression, the people are depressed and crafty. When the will to power is in charge, the higher the ideals, the lower the results. Try to make people happy, and you lay the groundwork for misery. Try to make people moral, and you lay the groundwork for vice. Thus the Master is content to serve as an example and not to impose her will. She is pointed, but doesn\'t pierce. Straightforward, but supple. Radiant, but easy on the eyes.',
    'For governing a country well there is nothing better than moderation. The mark of a moderate man is freedom from his own ideas. Tolerant like the sky, all-pervading like sunlight, firm like a mountain, supple like a tree in the wind, he has no destination in view and makes use of anything life happens to bring his way. Nothing is impossible for him. Because he has let go, he can care for the people\'s welfare as a mother cares for her child.',
    'Governing a large country is like frying a small fish. You spoil it with too much poking. Center your country in the Tao and evil will have no power. Not that it isn\'t there, but you\'ll be able to step out of its way. Give evil nothing to oppose and it will disappear by itself.',
    'When a country obtains great power, it becomes like the sea: all streams run downward into it. The more powerful it grows, the greater the need for humility. Humility means trusting the Tao, thus never needing to be defensive. A great nation is like a great man: When he makes a mistake, he realizes it. Having realized it, he admits it. Having admitted it, he corrects it. He considers those who point out his faults as his most benevolent teachers. He thinks of his enemy as the shadow that he himself casts. If a nation is centered in the Tao, if it nourishes its own people and doesn\'t meddle in the affairs of others, it will be a light to all nations in the world.',
    'The Tao is the center of the universe, the good man\'s treasure, the bad man\'s refuge. Honors can be bought with fine words, respect can be won with good deeds; but the Tao is beyond all value, and no one can achieve it. Thus, when a new leader is chosen, don\'t offer to help him with your wealth or your expertise. Offer instead to teach him about the Tao. Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao? Because, being one with the Tao, when you seek, you find; and when you make a mistake, you are forgiven. That is why everybody loves it.',
    'Act without doing; work without effort. Think of the small as large and the few as many. Confront the difficult while it is still easy; accomplish the great task by a series of small acts. The Master never reaches for the great; thus she achieves greatness. When she runs into a difficulty, she stops and gives herself to it. She doesn\'t cling to her own comfort; thus problems are no problem for her.',
    'What is rooted is easy to nourish. What is recent is easy to correct. What is brittle is easy to break. What is small is easy to scatter. Prevent trouble before it arises. Put things in order before they exist. The giant pine tree grows from a tiny sprout. The journey of a thousand miles starts from beneath your feet. Rushing into action, you fail. Trying to grasp things, you lose them. Forcing a project to completion, you ruin what was almost ripe. Therefore the Master takes action by letting things take their course. He remains as calm at the end as at the beginning. He has nothing, thus has nothing to lose. What he desires is non-desire; what he learns is to unlearn. He simply reminds people of who they have always been. He cares about nothing but the Tao. Thus he can care for all things.',
    'The ancient Masters didn\'t try to educate the people, but kindly taught them to not-know. When they think that they know the answers, people are difficult to guide. When they know that they don\'t know, people can find their own way. If you want to learn how to govern, avoid being clever or rich. The simplest pattern is the clearest. Content with an ordinary life, you can show all people the way back to their own true nature.',
    'All streams flow to the sea because it is lower than they are. Humility gives it its power. If you want to govern the people, you must place yourself below them. If you want to lead the people, you must learn how to follow them. The Master is above the people, and no one feels oppressed. She goes ahead of the people, and no one feels manipulated. The whole world is grateful to her. Because she competes with no one, no one can compete with her.',
    'Some say that my teaching is nonsense. Others call it lofty but impractical. But to those who have looked inside themselves, this nonsense makes perfect sense. And to those who put it into practice, this loftiness has roots that go deep. I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures. Simple in actions and in thoughts, you return to the source of being. Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are. Compassionate toward yourself, you reconcile all beings in the world.',
    'The best athlete wants his opponent at his best. The best general enters the mind of his enemy. The best businessman serves the communal good. The best leader follows the will of the people. All of them embody the virtue of non-competition. Not that they don\'t love to compete, but they do it in the spirit of play. In this they are like children and in harmony with the Tao.',
    'The generals have a saying: "Rather than make the first move it is better to wait and see. Rather than advance an inch it is better to retreat a yard." This is called going forward without advancing, pushing back without using weapons. There is no greater misfortune than underestimating your enemy. Underestimating your enemy means thinking that he is evil. Thus you destroy your three treasures and become an enemy yourself. When two great forces oppose each other, the victory will go to the one that knows how to yield.',
    'My teachings are easy to understand and easy to put into practice. Yet your intellect will never grasp them, and if you try to practice them, you\'ll fail. My teachings are older than the world. How can you grasp their meaning? If you want to know me, look inside your heart.',
    'Not-knowing is true knowledge. Presuming to know is a disease. First realize that you are sick; then you can move toward health. The Master is her own physician. She has healed herself of all knowing. Thus she is truly whole.',
    'When they lose their sense of awe, people turn to religion. When they no longer trust themselves, they begin to depend upon authority. Therefore the Master steps back so that people won\'t be confused. He teaches without a teaching, so that people will have nothing to learn.',
    'The Tao is always at ease. It overcomes without competing, answers without speaking a word, arrives without being summoned, accomplishes without a plan. Its net covers the whole universe. And though its meshes are wide, it doesn\'t let a thing slip through.',
    'If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to. If you aren\'t afraid of dying, there is nothing you can\'t achieve. Trying to control the future is like trying to take the master carpenter\'s place. When you handle the master carpenter\'s tools, chances are that you\'ll cut your hand.',
    'When taxes are too high, people go hungry. When the government is too intrusive, people lose their spirit. Act for the people\'s benefit. Trust them; leave them alone.',
    'Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail.',
    'As it acts in the world, the Tao is like the bending of a bow. The top is bent downward; the bottom is bent up. It adjusts excess and deficiency so that there is perfect balance. It takes from what is too much and give to what isn\'t enough. Those who try to control, who use force to protect their power, go against the direction of the Tao. They take from those who don\'t have enough and give to those who have far too much. The Master can keep giving because there is no end to her wealth. She acts without expectation, succeeds without taking credit, and doesn\'t think that she is better than anyone else.',
    'Nothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water. Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible, nothing can surpass it. The soft overcomes the hard; the gentle overcomes the rigid. Everyone knows this is true, but few can put it into practice. Therefore the Master remains serene in the midst of sorrow. Evil cannot enter his heart. Because he has given up helping, he is people\'s greatest help. True words seem paradoxical.',
    'Failure is an opportunity. If you blame someone else, there is no end to the blame. Therefore the Master fulfills her own obligations and corrects her own mistakes. She does what she needs to do and demands nothing of others.',
    'If a country is governed wisely, its inhabitants will be content. They enjoy the labor of their hands and don\'t waste time inventing labor-saving machines. Since they dearly love their homes, they aren\'t interested in travel. There may be a few wagons and boats, but these don\'t go anywhere. There may be an arsenal of weapons, but nobody ever uses them. People enjoy their food, take pleasure in being with their families, spend weekends working in their gardens, delight in the doings of the neighborhood. And even though the next country is so close that people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking, they are content to die of old age without ever having gone to see it.',
    'True words aren\'t eloquent; eloquent words aren\'t true. Wise men don\'t need to prove their point; men who need to prove their point aren\'t wise. The Master has no possessions. The more he does for others, the happier he is. The more he gives to others, the wealthier he is. The Tao nourishes by not forcing. By not dominating, the Master leads.',

  'Gia-Fu Feng & Jane English': [
    'The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth. The named is the mother of the ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery.',
    'Under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness. All can know good as good only because there is evil. Therefore having and not having arise together. Difficult and easy complement each other. Long and short contrast each other. High and low rest upon each other. Voice and sound harmonize each other. Front and back follow one another. Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking. The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease, creating, yet not possessing. Working, yet not taking credit. Work is done, then forgotten. Therefore it lasts forever.',
    'Not exalting the gifted prevents quarreling. Not collecting treasures prevents stealing. Not seeing desirable things prevents confusion of the heart. The wise therefore rule by emptying hearts and stuffing bellies, by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones. If men lack knowledge and desire, then clever people will not try to interfere. If nothing is done, then all will be well.',
    'The Tao is an empty vessel; it is used, but never filled. Oh, unfathomable source of ten thousand things! Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knot, soften the glare, merge with dust. Oh, hidden deep but ever present! I do not know from whence it comes. It is the forefather of the gods.',
    'Heaven and Earth are impartial; they see the ten thousand things as straw dogs. The wise are impartial; they see the people as straw dogs. The space between heaven and Earth is like a bellows. The shape changes but not the form; the more it moves, the more it yields. More words count less. Hold fast to the center.',
    'The valley spirit never dies; it is the woman, primal mother. Her gateway is the root of heaven and Earth. It is like a veil barely seen. Use it; it will never fail.',
    'Heaven and Earth last forever. Why do heaven and Earth last forever? They are unborn, so ever living. The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead. He is detached, thus at one with all. Through selfless action, he attains fulfillment.',
    'The highest good is like water. Water gives life to the ten thousand things and does not strive. It flows in places men reject and so is like the Tao. In dwelling, be close to the land. In meditation, go deep in the heart. In dealing with others, be gentle and kind. In speech, be true. In ruling, be just. In daily life, be competent. In action, be aware of the time and the season. No fight: no blame.',
    'Better to stop short than fill to the brim. Oversharpen the blade and the edge will soon blunt. Amass a store of gold and jade and no one can protect it. Claim wealth and titles, and disaster will follow. Retire when the work is done. This is the way of heaven.',
    'Carrying body and soul and embracing the one, can you avoid separation? Attending fully and becoming supple, can you be as a newborn babe? Washing and cleansing the primal vision, can you be without stain? Loving all men and ruling the country, can you be without cleverness? Opening and closing the gates of heaven, can you play the role of woman? Understanding and being open to all things, are you able to do nothing? Giving birth and nourishing, bearing yet not possessing, working yet not taking credit, leading yet not dominating. This is the Primal Virtue.',
    'Thirty spokes share the wheel\'s hub; it is the center hole that makes it useful. Shape clay into a vessel; it is the space within that makes it useful. Cut doors and windows for a room; it is the holes which make it useful. Therefore benefit comes from what is there, usefulness from what is not there.',
    'The five colors blind the eye. The five tones deafen the ear. The five flavors dull the taste. Racing and hunting madden the mind. Precious things lead one astray. Therefore the sage is guided by what he feels and not by what he sees. He lets go of that and chooses this.',
    'Accept disgrace willingly. Accept misfortune as the human condition. What do you mean by "Accept disgrace willingly"? Accept being unimportant. Do not be concerned with loss or gain. This is called "accepting disgrace willingly." What do you mean by "Accept misfortune as the human condition"? Misfortune comes from having a body. Without a body, how could there be misfortune? Surrender yourself humbly, then you can be trusted to care for all things. Love the world as your own self, then you can truly care for all things.',
    'Look, it cannot be seen - it is beyond form. Listen, it cannot be heard - it is beyond sound. Grasp, it cannot be held - it is intangible. These three are indefinable; therefore they are joined in one. From above it is not bright, from below it is not dark. An unbroken thread beyond description. It returns to nothingness. The form of the formless, the image of the imageless, it is called indefinable and beyond imagination. Stand before it and there is no beginning. Follow it and there is no end. Stay with the ancient Tao, move with the present. Knowing the ancient beginning is the essence of Tao.',
    'The ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound, responsive. The depth of their knowledge is unfathomable. Because it is unfathomable, all we can do is describe their appearance. Watchful, like men crossing a winter stream. Alert, like men aware of danger. Courteous, like visiting guests. Yielding, like ice about to melt. Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood. Hollow, like caves. Opaque, like muddy pools. Who can wait quietly while the mud settles? Who can remain still until the moment of action? Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfillment. Not seeking fulfillment, they are not swayed by desire for change.',
    'Empty yourself of everything. Let the mind become still. The ten thousand things rise and fall while the self watches their return. They grow and flourish and then return to the source. Returning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature. The way of nature is unchanging. Knowing constancy is insight. Not knowing constancy leads to disaster. Knowing constancy, the mind is open. With an open mind, you will be openhearted. Being openhearted, you will act royally. Being royal, you will attain the divine. Being divine, you will be at one with the Tao. Being at one with the Tao is eternal. And though the body dies, the Tao will never pass away.',
    'The very highest if barely known. Then comes that which people know and love. Then that which is feared, then that which is despised. Who does not trust enough will not be trusted. When actions are performed without unnecessary speech, people say, "We did it!"',
    'When the great Tao is forgotten, kindness and morality arise. When wisdom and intelligence are born, the great pretense begins. When there is no peace within the family, filial piety and devotion arise. When the country is confused and in chaos, loyal ministers appear.',
    'Give up sainthood, renounce wisdom, and it will be a hundred times better for everyone. Give up kindness, renounce morality, and men will rediscover filial piety and love. Give up ingenuity, renounce profit, and bandits and thieves will disappear. These three are outward forms alone; they are not sufficient in themselves. It is more important to see the simplicity, to realize one\'s true nature, to cast off selfishness and temper desire.',
    'Give up learning, and put an end to your troubles. Is there a difference between yes and no? Is there a difference between good and evil? Must I fear what others fear? What nonsense! Other people are contented, enjoying the sacrificial feast of the ox. In spring some go to the park and climb the terrace, but I alone am drifting, not knowing where I am. Like a newborn babe before it learns to smile, I am alone, without a place to go. Others have more than they need, but I alone have nothing. I am a fool. Oh, yes! I am confused. Others are clear and bright, but I alone am dim and weak. Others are sharp and clever, but I alone am dull and stupid. Oh, I drift like the waves of the sea, without direction, like the restless wind. Everyone else is busy, but I alone am aimless and depressed. I am different. I am nourished by the great mother.',
    'The greatest Virtue is to follow Tao and Tao alone. The Tao is elusive and intangible. Oh, it is intangible and elusive, and yet within is image. Oh, it is elusive and intangible, and yet within is form. Oh, it is dim and dark, and yet within is essence. This essence is very real, and therein lies faith. From the very beginning until now its name has never been forgotten. Thus I perceive the creation. How do I know the ways of creation? Because of this.',
    'Yield and overcome; bend and be straight; empty and be full; wear out and be new; have little and gain; have much and be confused. Therefore the wise embrace the one and set an example to all. Not putting on a display, they shine forth. Not justifying themselves, they are distinguished. Not boasting, they receive recognition. Not bragging, they never falter. They do not quarrel, so no one quarrels with them. Therefore the ancients say, "Yield and overcome." Is that an empty saying? Be really whole, and all things will come to you.',
    'To talk little is natural. High winds do not last all morning. Heavy rain does not last all day. Why is this? Heaven and Earth! If heaven and Earth cannot make things eternal, how is it possible for man? He who follows the Tao is at one with the Tao. He who is virtuous experiences Virtue. He who loses the way is lost. When you are at one with the Tao, the Tao welcomes you. When you are at one with Virtue, the Virtue is always there. When you are at one with loss, the loss is experienced willingly. He who does not trust enough will not be trusted.',
    'He who stands on tiptoe is not steady. He who strides cannot maintain the pace. He who makes a show is not enlightened. He who is self-righteous is not respected. He who boasts achieves nothing. He who brags will not endure. According to followers of the Tao, "These are extra food and unnecessary luggage." They do not bring happiness, therefore followers of the Tao avoid them.',
    'Something mysteriously formed, born before heaven and Earth. In the silence and the void, standing alone and unchanging, ever present and in motion. Perhaps it is the mother of ten thousand things. I do not know its name. Call it Tao. For lack of a better word, I call it great. Being great, it flows. It flows far away. Having gone far, it returns. Therefore, "Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; the king is also great." These are the four great powers of the universe, and the king is one of them. Man follows Earth. Earth follows heaven. Heaven follows the Tao. Tao follows what is natural.',
    'The heavy is the root of the light. The still is the master of unrest. Therefore the sage, traveling all day, does not lose sight of his baggage. Though there are beautiful things to be seen, he remains unattached and calm. Why should the lord of ten thousand chariots act lightly in public? To be light is to lose one\'s root. To be restless is to lose one\'s control.',
    'A good walker leaves no tracks; a good speaker makes no slips; a good reckoner needs no tally. A good door needs no lock, yet no one can open it. Good binding requires no knots, yet no one can loosen it. Therefore the sage takes care of all men and abandons no one. He takes care of all things and abandons nothing. This is called "following the light." What is a good man? A teacher of a bad man. What is a bad man? A good man\'s charge. If the teacher is not respected, and the student not cared for, confusion will arise, however clever one is. This is the crux of mystery.',
    'Know the strength of man, but keep a woman\'s care! Be the stream of the universe! Being the stream of the universe, ever true and unswerving, become as a little child once more. Know the white, but keep the black! Be an example to the world! Being an example to the world, ever true and unwavering, return to the infinite. Know honor, yet keep humility. Be the valley of the universe! Being the valley of the universe, ever true and resourceful, return to the state of the uncarved block. When the block is carved, it becomes useful. When the sage uses it, he becomes the ruler. Thus, "A great tailor cuts little."',
    'Do you think you can take over the universe and improve it? I do not believe it can be done. The universe is sacred. You cannot improve it. If you try to change it, you will ruin it. If you try to hold it, you will lose it. So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind; sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily; sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness; sometimes one is up and sometimes down. Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.',
    'Whenever you advise a ruler in the way of Tao, counsel him not to use force to conquer the universe. For this would only cause resistance. Thorn bushes spring up wherever the army has passed. Lean years follow in the wake of a great war. Just do what needs to be done. Never take advantage of power. Achieve results, but never glory in them. Achieve results, but never boast. Achieve results, but never be proud. Achieve results, because this is the natural way. Achieve results, but not through violence. Force is followed by loss of strength. This is not the way of Tao. That which goes against the Tao comes to an early end.',
    'Good weapons are instruments of fear; all creatures hate them. Therefore followers of Tao never use them. The wise man prefers the left. The man of war prefers the right. Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man\'s tools. He uses them only when he has no choice. Peace and quiet are dear to his heart, and victory no cause for rejoicing. If you rejoice in victory, then you delight in killing; if you delight in killing, you cannot fulfill yourself. On happy occasions precedence is given to the left, on sad occasions to the right. In the army the general stands on the left, the commander-in-chief on the right. This means that war is conducted like a funeral. When many people are being killed, they should be mourned in heartfelt sorrow. That is why a victory must be observed like a funeral.',
    'The Tao is forever undefined. Small though it is in the unformed state, it cannot be grasped. If kings and lords could harness it, the ten thousand things would come together and gentle rain fall. Men would need no more instruction and all things would take their course. Once the whole is divided, the parts need names. There are already enough names. One must know when to stop. Knowing when to stop averts trouble. Tao in the world is like a river flowing home to the sea.',
    'Knowing others is wisdom; knowing the self is enlightenment. Mastering others requires force; mastering the self needs strength. He who knows he has enough is rich. Perseverance is a sign of willpower. He who stays where he is endures. To die but not to perish is to be eternally present.',
    'The great Tao flows everywhere, both to the left and to the right. The ten thousand things depend upon it; it holds nothing back. It fulfills its purpose silently and makes no claim. It nourishes the ten thousand things, and yet is not their lord. It has no aim; it is very small. The ten thousand things return to it, yet it is not their lord. It is very great. It does not show greatness, and is therefore truly great.',
    'All men will come to him who keeps to the one, for there lie rest and happiness and peace. Passersby may stop for music and good food, but a description of the Tao seems without substance or flavor. It cannot be seen, it cannot be heard, and yet it cannot be exhausted.',
    'That which shrinks must first expand. That which fails must first be strong. That which is cast down must first be raised. Before receiving there must be giving. This is called perception of the nature of things. Soft and weak overcome hard and strong. Fish cannot leave deep waters, and a country\'s weapons should not be displayed.',
    'Tao abides in non-action, yet nothing is left undone. If kings and lords observed this, the ten thousand things would develop naturally. If they still desired to act, they would return to the simplicity of formless substance. Without form there is no desire. Without desire there is tranquility. And in this way all things would be at peace.',
    'A truly good man is not aware of his goodness, and is therefore good. A foolish man tries to be good, and is therefore not good. A truly good man does nothing, yet leaves nothing undone. A foolish man is always doing, yet much remains to be done. When a truly kind man does something, he leaves nothing undone. When a just man does something, he leaves a great deal to be done. When a disciplinarian does something and no one responds, he rolls up his sleeves in an attempt to enforce order. Therefore when Tao is lost, there is goodness. When goodness is lost, there is kindness. When kindness is lost, there is justice. When justice is lost, there is ritual. Now ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty, the beginning of confusion. Knowledge of the future is only a flowery trapping of Tao. It is the beginning of folly. Therefore the truly great man dwells on what is real and not what is on the surface, on the fruit and not the flower. Therefore accept the one and reject the other.',
    'These things from ancient times arise from one: The sky is whole and clear. The earth is whole and firm. The spirit is whole and strong. The valley is whole and full. The ten thousand things are whole and alive. Kings and lords are whole, and the country is upright. All these are in virtue of wholeness. The clarity of the sky prevents its falling. The firmness of the earth prevents its splitting. The strength of the spirit prevents its being used up. The fullness of the valley prevents its running dry. The growth of the ten thousand things prevents their drying out. The leadership of kings and lords prevents the downfall of the country. Therefore the humble is the root of the noble. The low is the foundation of the high. Princes and lords consider themselves "orphaned," "widowed," and "worthless". Do they not depend on being humble? Too much success is not an advantage. Do not tinkle like jade or clatter like stone chimes.',
    'Returning is the motion of the Tao. Yielding is the way of the Tao. The ten thousand things are born of being. Being is born of not being.',
    'The wise student hears of the Tao and practices it diligently. The average student hears of the Tao and gives it thought now and again. The foolish student hears of the Tao and laughs aloud. If there were no laughter, the Tao would not be what it is. Hence it is said: The bright path seems dim; going forward seems like retreat; the easy way seems hard; the highest Virtue seems empty; great purity seems sullied; a wealth of Virtue seems inadequate; the strength of Virtue seems frail; real Virtue seems unreal; the perfect square has no corners; great talents ripen late; the highest notes are hard to hear; the greatest form has no shape; the Tao is hidden and without name. The Tao alone nourishes and brings everything to fulfillment.',
    'The Tao begot one. One begot two. Two begot three. And three begot the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang. They achieve harmony by combining these forces. Men hate to be "orphaned," "widowed," or "worthless," but this is how kings and lords describe themselves. For one gains by losing and loses by gaining. What others teach, I also teach; that is: "A violent man will die a violent death!" This will be the essence of my teaching.',
    'The softest thing in the universe overcomes the hardest thing in the universe. That without substance can enter where there is no room. Hence I know the value of non-action. Teaching without words and work without doing are understood by very few.',
    'Fame or self: Which matters more? Self or wealth: Which is more precious? Gain or loss: Which is more painful? He who is attached to things will suffer much. He who saves will suffer heavy loss. A contented man is never disappointed. He who knows when to stop does not find himself in trouble. He will stay forever safe.',
    'Great accomplishment seems imperfect, yet it does not outlive its usefulness. Great fullness seems empty, yet cannot be exhausted. Great straightness seems twisted. Great intelligence seems stupid. Great eloquence seems awkward. Movement overcomes cold. Stillness overcomes heat. Stillness and tranquillity set things in order in the universe.',
    'When the Tao is present in the universe, the horses haul manure. When the Tao is absent from the universe, war horses are bred outside the city. There is no greater sin than desire, no greater curse than discontent, no greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself. Therefore he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.',
    'Without going outside, you may know the whole world. Without looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven. The farther you go, the less you know. Thus the sage knows without traveling; he sees without looking; he works without doing.',
    'In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired. In the pursuit of Tao, every day something is dropped. Less and less is done until non-action is achieved. When nothing is done, nothing is left undone. The world is ruled by letting things take their course. It cannot be ruled by interfering.',
    'The sage has no mind of his own. He is aware of the needs of others. I am good to people who are good. I am also good to people who are not good. Because Virtue is goodness. I have faith in people who are faithful. I also have faith in people who are not faithful. Because Virtue is faithfulness. The sage is shy and humble - to the world he seems confusing. Others look to him and listen. He behaves like a little child.',
    'Between birth and death, three in ten are followers of life, three in ten are followers of death, and men just passing from birth to death also number three in ten. Why is this so? Because they live their lives on the gross level. He who knows how to live can walk abroad without fear of rhinoceros or tiger. He will not be wounded in battle. For in him rhinoceroses can find no place to thrust their horn, tigers no place to use their claws, and weapons no place to pierce. Why is this so? Because he has no place for death to enter.',
    'All things arise from Tao. They are nourished by Virtue. They are formed from matter. They are shaped by environment. Thus the ten thousand things all respect Tao and honor Virtue. Respect of Tao and honor of Virtue are not demanded, but they are in the nature of things. Therefore all things arise from Tao. By Virtue they are nourished, developed, cared for, sheltered, comforted, grown, and protected. Creating without claiming, doing without taking credit, guiding without interfering, this is Primal Virtue.',
    'The beginning of the universe is the mother of all things. Knowing the mother, one also knows the sons. Knowing the sons, yet remaining in touch with the mother, brings freedom from the fear of death. Keep your mouth shut, guard the senses, and life is ever full. Open your mouth, always be busy, and life is beyond hope. Seeing the small is insight; yielding to force is strength. Using the outer light, return to insight, and in this way be saved from harm. This is learning constancy.',
    'If I have even just a little sense, I will walk on the main road and my only fear will be of straying from it. Keeping to the main road is easy, but people love to be sidetracked. When the court is arrayed in splendor, the fields are full of weeds, and the granaries are bare. Some wear gorgeous clothes, carry sharp swords, and indulge themselves with food and drink; they have more possessions than they can use. They are robber barons. This is certainly not the way of Tao.',
    'What is firmly established cannot be uprooted. What is firmly grasped cannot slip away. It will be honored from generation to generation. Cultivate Virtue in your self, and Virtue will be real. Cultivate it in the family, and Virtue will abound. Cultivate it in the village, and Virtue will grow. Cultivate it in the nation, and Virtue will be abundant. Cultivate it in the universe, and Virtue will be everywhere. Therefore look at the body as body; look at the family as family; look at the village as village; look at the nation as nation; look at the universe as universe. How do I know the universe is like this? By looking!',
    'He who is filled with Virtue is like a newborn child. Wasps and serpents will not sting him; wild beasts will not pounce upon him; he will not be attacked by birds of prey. His bones are soft, his muscles weak, but his grip is firm. He has not experienced the union of man and woman, but is whole. His manhood is strong. He screams all day without becoming hoarse. This is perfect harmony. Knowing harmony is constancy. Knowing constancy is enlightenment. It is not wise to rush about. Controlling the breath causes strain. If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows. This is not the way of Tao. Whatever is contrary to Tao will not last long.',
    'Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know. Keep your mouth closed. Guard your senses. Temper your sharpness. Simplify your problems. Mask your brightness. Be at one with the dust of the Earth. This is primal union. He who has achieved this state is unconcerned with friends and enemies, with good and harm, with honor and disgrace. This therefore is the highest state of man.',
    'Rule a nation with justice. Wage war with surprise moves. Become master of the universe without striving. How do I know that this is so? Because of this! The more laws and restrictions there are, the poorer people become. The sharper men\'s weapons, the more trouble in the land. The more ingenious and clever men are, the more strange things happen. The more rules and regulations, the more thieves and robbers. Therefore the sage says: I take no action and people are reformed. I enjoy peace and people become honest. I do nothing and people become rich. I have no desires and people return to the good and simple life.',
    'When the country is ruled with a light hand the people are simple. When the country is ruled with severity, the people are cunning. Happiness is rooted in misery. Misery lurks beneath happiness. Who knows what the future holds? There is no honesty. Honesty becomes dishonest. Goodness becomes witchcraft. Man\'s bewitchment lasts for a long time. Therefore the sage is sharp but not cutting, pointed but not piercing, straightforward but not unrestrained, brilliant but not blinding.',
    'In caring for others and serving heaven, there is nothing like using restraint. Restraint begins with giving up one\'s own ideas. This depends on Virtue gathered in the past. If there is a good store of Virtue, then nothing is impossible. If nothing is impossible, then there are no limits. If a man knows no limits, then he is fit to be a ruler. The mother principle of ruling holds good for a long time. This is called having deep roots and a firm foundation, the Tao of long life and eternal vision.',
    'Ruling the country is like cooking a small fish. Approach the universe with Tao, and evil is not powerful, but its power will not be used to harm others. Not only will it do no harm to others, but the sage himself will also be protected. They do not hurt each other, and the Virtue in each one refreshes both.',
    'A great country is like low land. It is the meeting ground of the universe, the mother of the universe. The female overcomes the male with stillness, lying low in stillness. Therefore if a great country gives way to a smaller country, it will conquer the smaller country. And if a small country submits to a great country, it can conquer the great country. Therefore those who would conquer must yield, and those who conquer do so because they yield. A great nation needs more people; a small country needs to serve. Each gets what it wants. It is fitting for a great nation to yield.',
    'Tao is source of the ten thousand things. It is the treasure of the good man, and the refuge of the bad. Sweet words can buy honor; good deeds can gain respect. If a man is bad, do not abandon him. Therefore on the day the emperor is crowned, or the three officers of state installed, do not send a gift of jade and a team of four horses, but remain still and offer the Tao. Why does everyone like the Tao so much at first? Isn\'t it because you find what you seek and are forgiven when you sin? Therefore this is the greatest treasure of the universe.',
    'Practice non-action. Work without doing. Taste the tasteless. Magnify the small, increase the few. Reward bitterness with care. See simplicity in the complicated. Achieve greatness in little things. In the universe the difficult things are done as if they are easy. In the universe great acts are made up of small deeds. The sage does not attempt anything very big, and thus achieved greatness. Easy promises make for little trust. Taking things lightly results in great difficulty. Because the sage always confronts difficulties, he never experiences them.',
    'Peace is easily maintained; trouble is easily overcome before it starts. The brittle is easily shattered; the small is easily scattered. Deal with it before it happens. Set things in order before there is confusion. A tree as great as a man\'s embrace springs up from a small shoot; a terrace nine stories high begins with a pile of earth; a journey of a thousand miles starts under one\'s feet. He who acts defeats his own purpose; he who grasps loses. The sage does not act, and so is not defeated. He does not grasp and therefore does not lose. People usually fail when they are on the verge of success. So give as much care to the end as to the beginning; then there will be no failure. Therefore the sage seeks freedom from desire. He does not collect precious things. He learns not to hold on to ideas. He brings men back to what they have lost. He helps the ten thousand things find their own nature, but refrains from action.',
    'In the beginning those who knew the Tao did not try to enlighten others, but kept it hidden. Why is it so hard to rule? Because people are so clever. Rulers who try to use cleverness cheat the country. Those who rule without cleverness are a blessing to the land. These are the two alternatives. Understanding these is Primal Virtue. Primal Virtue is deep and far. It leads all things back toward the great oneness.',
    'Why is the sea king of a hundred streams? Because it lies below them. Therefore it is the king of a hundred streams. If the sage would guide the people, he must serve with humility. If he would lead them, he must follow behind. In this way when the sage rules, the people will not feel oppressed; when he stands before them, they will not be harmed. The whole world will support him and will not tire of him. Because he does not compete, he does not meet competition.',
    'Everyone under heaven says that my Tao is great and beyond compare. Because it is great, it seems different. If it were not different, it would have vanished long ago. I have three treasures which I hold and keep. The first is mercy; the second is economy; the third is daring not to be ahead of others. From mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity; from humility comes leadership. Nowadays men shun mercy, but try to be brave; they abandon economy, but try to be generous; they do not believe in humility, but always try to be first. This is certain death. Mercy brings victory in battle and strength in defense. It is the means by which heaven saves and guards.',
    'A good soldier is not violent. A good fighter is not angry. A good winner is not vengeful. A good employer is humble. This is known as the Virtue of not striving. This is known as ability to deal with people. This since ancient times has been known as the ultimate unity with heaven.',
    'There is a saying among soldiers: I dare not make the first move but would rather play the guest; I dare not advance an inch but would rather withdraw a foot. This is called marching without appearing to move, rolling up your sleeves without showing your arm, capturing the enemy without attacking, being armed without weapons. There is no greater catastrophe than underestimating the enemy. By underestimating the enemy, I almost lost what I value. Therefore when the battle is joined, the underdog will win.',
    'My words are easy to understand and easy to perform, yet no man under heaven knows them or practices them. My words have ancient beginnings. My actions are disciplined. Because men do not understand, they have no knowledge of me. Those that know me are few; those that abuse me are honored. Therefore the sage wears rough clothing and holds the jewel in his heart.',
    'Knowing ignorance is strength. Ignoring knowledge is sickness. If one is sick of sickness, then one is not sick. The sage is not sick because he is sick of sickness. Therefore he is not sick.',
    'When men lack a sense of awe, there will be disaster. Do not intrude in their homes. Do not harass them at work. If you do not interfere, they will not weary of you. Therefore the sage knows himself but makes no show, has self-respect but is not arrogant. He lets go of that and chooses this.',
    'A brave and passionate man will kill or be killed. A brave and calm man will always preserve life. Of these two which is good and which is harmful? Some things are not favored by heaven. Who knows why? Even the sage is unsure of this. The Tao of heaven does not strive, and yet it overcomes. It does not speak, and yet is answered. It does not ask, yet is supplied with all its needs. It seems to have no aim and yet its purpose is fulfilled. Heaven\'s net casts wide. Though its meshes are course, nothing slips through.',
    'If men are not afraid to die, it is no avail to threaten them with death. If men live in constant fear of dying, and if breaking the law means that a man will be killed, who will dare to break the law? There is always an official executioner. If you try to take his place, it is like trying to be a master carpenter and cutting wood. If you try to cut wood like a master carpenter, you will only hurt your hand.',
    'Why are the people starving? Because the rulers eat up the money in taxes. Therefore the people are starving. Why are the people rebellious? Because the rulers interfere too much. Therefore they are rebellious. Why do the people think so little of death? Because the rulers demand too much of life. Therefore the people take death lightly. Having little to live on, one knows better than to value life too much.',
    'A man is born gentle and weak. At his death he is hard and stiff. Green plants are tender and filled with sap. At their death they are withered and dry. Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death. The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life. Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle. A tree that is unbending is easily broken. The hard and strong will fall. The soft and weak will overcome.',
    'The Tao of heaven is like the bending of a bow. The high is lowered, and the low is raised. If the string is too long, it is shortened; if there is not enough, it is made longer. The Tao of heaven is to take from those who have too much and give to those who do not have enough. Man\'s way is different. He takes from those who do not have enough and gives to those who already have too much. What man has more than enough and gives it to the world? Only the man of Tao. Therefore the sage works without recognition. He achieves what has to be done without dwelling on it. He does not try to show his knowledge.',
    'Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water. Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better; it has no equal. The weak can overcome the strong; the supple can overcome the stiff. Under heaven everyone knows this, yet no one puts it into practice. Therefore the sage says: He who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people is fit to rule them. He who takes upon himself the country\'s disasters deserves to be king of the universe. The truth often sounds paradoxical.',
    'After a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain. What can one do about it? Therefore the sage keeps his half of the bargain but does not exact his due. A man of Virtue performs his part, but a man without Virtue requires others to fulfill their obligations. The Tao of heaven is impartial. It stays with good men all the time.',
    'A small country has fewer people. Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed. The people take death seriously and do not travel far. Though they have boats and carriages, no one uses them. Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them. Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing. Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure; they are happy in their ways. Though they live within sight of their neighbors, and crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way, yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die.',
    'Truthful words are not beautiful. Beautiful words are not truthful. Good men do not argue. Those who argue are not good. Those who know are not learned. The learned do not know. The sage never tries to store things up. The more he does for others, the more he has. The more he gives to others, the greater his abundance. The Tao of heaven is pointed but does no harm. The Tao of the sage is work without effort.',

  'Stephen Addiss & Stanley Lombardo': [
    'Tao called Tao is not Tao. Names can name no lasting name. Nameless: the origin of heaven and earth. Naming: the mother of ten thousand things. Empty of desire, perceive mystery. Filled with desire, perceive manifestations. These have the same source, but different names. Call them both deep - deep and again deep: the gateway to all mystery.',
    'Recognize beauty and ugliness is born. Recognize good and evil is born. Is and isn\'t produce each other. Hard depends on easy, long is tested by short, high is determined by low, sound is harmonized by voice, after is followed by before. Therefore the sage is devoted to non action, moves without teaching, creates ten thousand things without instruction, lives but does not own, acts but does not presume, accomplishes without taking credit. When no credit is taken, accomplishment endures.',
    'Don\'t glorify heroes and people will not contend. Don\'t treasure rare objects and no one will steal. Don\'t display what people desire and their hearts will not be disturbed. Therefore, the Sage rules by emptying hearts and filling bellies, by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones; leads people away from knowing and wanting; deters those who know too much from going too far: practices non-action and the natural order is not disrupted.',
    'Tao is empty - its use never exhausted. Bottomless - the origin of all things. It blunts sharp edges, unties knots, softens glare, becomes one with the dusty world. Deeply subsistent - I don\'t know whose child it is. It is older than the Ancestor.',
    'Heaven and Earth are not kind: The ten thousand things are straw dogs to them. The Sage is not kind: People are straw dogs to him. Yet Heaven and Earth and all the space between are like a bellows: Empty but inexhaustible, always producing more. Longwinded speech is exhausting. Better to stay centered.',
    'The Valley Spirit never dies. It is called the Mysterious Female. The entrance to the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Endless flow of inexhaustible energy.',
    'Heaven is long, Earth enduring. Long and enduring because they do not exist for themselves. Therefore the Sage steps back, but is always in front, stays outside, but is always within. No self-interest? Self is fulfilled?',
    'Best to be like water, which benefits the ten thousand things and does not contend. It pools where humans disdain to dwell, close to the Tao. Live in a good place. Keep your mind deep. Treat others well. Stand by your word. Make fair rules. Do the right thing. Work when it\'s time. Only do not contend, and you will not go wrong.',
    'Hold and fill it - not as good as stopping in time. Measure and pound it - it will not long survive. When gold and jade fill the hall, they cannot be guarded. Riches and pride bequeath error. Withdrawing when work is done: Heaven\'s Tao.',
    'Can you balance your life force and embrace the One without separation? Can you control your breath gently like a baby? Can you clarify your dark vision without blemish? Can you love people and govern the country without knowledge? Can you open and close the gate of heaven without clinging to earth? Can you brighten the four directions without action? Give birth and cultivate. Give birth and do not possess. Act without dependence. Excel but do not rule. This is called the dark Te.',
    'Thirty spokes join one hub. The wheel\'s use comes from emptiness. Clay is fired to make a pot. The pot\'s use comes from emptiness. Windows and doors are cut to make a room. The room\'s use comes from emptiness. Therefore, having leads to profit, not having leads to use.',
    'Five colors darken the eyes. Five tones darken the ears. Five tastes jade the palate. Hunting and racing madden the heart. Exotic goods ensnarl human lives. Therefore the Sage takes care of the belly, not the eye, chooses one, rejects the other.',
    'Favour and disgrace are like fear. Honour and distress are like the self. What does this mean? Favour debases us. Afraid when we get it, afraid when we lose it. The self embodies distress. No self, no distress. Respect the world as your self: The world can be your lodging. Love the world as your self: The world can be your trust.',
    'Seeing but not seeing, we call it dim. Listening but not hearing, we call it faint. Groping but not touching, we call it subtle. These three cannot be fully grasped. Therefore they become one. Rising, it is not bright; setting, it is not dark. It moves all things back to where there is nothing. Meeting it there is no front, following it there is no back. Live in the ancient Tao, master the existing present, understand the source of all things. This is called the record of Tao.',
    'The ancients who followed Tao: Dark, wondrous, profound, penetrating. Deep beyond knowing. Because they cannot be known, they can only be described. Cautious, like crossing a winter stream. Hesitant, like respecting one\'s neighbours. Polite, like a guest. Yielding, like ice about to melt. Blank, like uncarved wood. Open, like a valley. Mixing freely, like muddy water. Calm the muddy water, it becomes clear. Move the inert, it comes to life. Those who sustain Tao do not wish to be full. Because they do not wish to be full they can fade away without further effort.',
    'Attain complete emptiness, hold fast to stillness. The ten thousand things stir about; I only watch for their going back. Things grow and grow, but each goes back to its root. Going back to the root is stillness. This means returning to what is. Returning to what is means going back to the ordinary. Understanding the ordinary: Enlightenment. Not understanding the ordinary: Blindness creates evil. Understanding the ordinary: Mind opens. Mind opening leads to compassion, compassion to nobility, nobility to heavenliness, heavenliness to Tao. Tao endures. Your body dies. There is no danger.',
    'Great rising and falling - people only know it exists. Next they see and praise. Soon they fear. Finally they despise. Without fundamental trust there is no trust at all. Be careful in valuing words. When the work is done, everyone says we just acted naturally.',
    'Great Tao rejected: Benevolence and righteousness appear. Learning and knowledge professed: Great hypocrites spring up. Family relations forgotten: Filial piety and affection arise. The nation disordered: Patriots come forth.',
    'Banish learning, discard knowledge: People will gain a hundredfold. Banish benevolence, discard righteousness: People will return to duty and compassion. Banish skill, discard profit: There will be no more thieves. These three statements are not enough. One more step is necessary. Look at plain silk; hold uncarved wood. The self dwindles; desires fade.',
    'Banish learning, no more grief. Between yes and no how much difference? Between good and evil how much difference? What others fear I must fear - How pointless! People are wreathed in smiles as if at a carnival banquet. I alone am passive, giving no sign, like an infant who has not yet smiled. Forlorn as if I had no home. Others have enough and more, I alone am left out. I have the mind of a fool, confused, confused. Others are bright and intelligent, I alone am dull, dull, drifting on the ocean, blown about endlessly. Others have plans, I alone am wayward and stubborn, I alone am different from others, like a baby in the womb.',
    'Great Te appears flowing from Tao. Tao in action - only vague and intangible. Intangible and vague, but within it are images. Vague and intangible; within are entities. Shadowy and obscure; within there is life, life so real, that within it there is trust. From the beginning its name is not lost but reappears through multiple origins. How do I know these origins? Like this.',
    'Crippled become whole, crooked becomes straight, hollow becomes full, worn becomes new, little becomes more, much becomes delusion. Therefore the Sages cling to the One and take care of this world; do not display themselves and therefore shine. Do not assert themselves and therefore stand out. Do not praise themselves and therefore succeed. Do not contend and therefore no one under heaven can contend with them. The old saying crippled becomes whole is not empty words. It becomes whole and returns.',
    'Spare words; nature\'s way. Violent winds do not blow all morning. Sudden rain cannot pour all day. What causes these things? Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth do not blow and pour for long, how much less should humans? Therefore in following Tao: Those on the way become the way, those who gain become the gain, those who lose become the loss. All within the Tao: The wayfarer, welcome upon the way, those who gain, welcome within gain, those who lose, welcome within loss. Without trust in this, there is no trust at all.',
    'Upon tiptoe: no way to stand. Clambering: no way to walk. Self-display: no way to shine. Self-assertion: no way to succeed. Self-praise: no way to flourish. Complacency: no way to endure. According to Tao, excessive food, extraneous activity inspire disgust. Therefore the follower of Tao moves on.',
    'Something unformed and complete before Heaven and Earth were born, solitary and silent, stands alone and unchanging. Pervading all things without limit. It is like the mother of all things under heaven, but I don\'t know its name - better call it Tao. Better call it great. Great means passing on. Passing on means going far. Going far means returning. Therefore Tao is great, and heaven, and earth, and humans. Four great things in the world. Aren\'t humans one of them? Humans follow earth. Earth follows heaven. Heaven follows Tao. Tao follows its own nature.',
    'Gravity is the root of lightness, stillness the master of passion. The Sage travels all day but does not leave the baggage-cart; when surrounded by magnificent scenery remains calm and still. When a lord of ten thousand chariots behaves lightly in this world, lightness loses its root, passion loses its master.',
    'Good travelers leave no tracks. Good words leave no trace. Good counting needs no markers. Good doors have no bolts yet cannot be forced. Good knots have no rope but cannot be untied. In this way the Sage always helps people and rejects none, always helps all beings, and rejects none. This is called practicing brightness. Therefore the good person is the bad person\'s teacher, and the bad person is the good person\'s resource. Not to value the teacher, not to love the resource, causes great confusion even for the intelligent. This is called the vital secret.',
    'Know the male, maintain the female, become the channel of the world, and Te will endure. Return to infancy. Know the white, sustain the black, become the pattern of the world, and Te will not falter. Return to the uncarved block. Know honour, sustain disgrace, become the valley of the world, and Te will prevail. Return to simplicity. Simplicity divided becomes utensils that are used by the Sage as high official. But great governing does not carve up.',
    'Trying to control the world? I see you won\'t succeed. The world is a spiritual vessel and cannot be controlled. Those who control, fail. Those who grasp, lose. Some go forth, some are led, some weep, some blow flutes, some become strong, some superfluous, some oppress, some are destroyed. Therefore the Sage casts off extremes, casts off excess, casts off extravagance.',
    'Use Tao to help rule people. This world has no need for weapons, which soon turn on themselves. Where armies camp, nettles grow. After each war, years of famine. The most fruitful outcome does not depend on force, but succeeds without arrogance without hostility without pride without resistance without violence. If these things prosper and grow old, this is called not-Tao. Not-Tao soon ends.',
    'Fine weapons are ill-omened tools. They are hated. Therefore the old Tao ignores them. At home, honour the left. In war, honor the right. Good omens honour the left. Bad omens honour the right. The lieutenant on the left, the general on the right as in funeral ceremonies. Weapons are ill-omened, not proper instruments. When their use can\'t be avoided, calm restraint is best. Don\'t think they are beautiful. Those who think they are beautiful rejoice in killing people. Those who rejoice in killing people cannot achieve their purpose in this world. When many people are killed we feel sorrow and grief. A great victory is a funeral ceremony.',
    'Tao endures without a name. Though simple and slight, no one under heaven can master it. If kings and lords could posses it, all beings would become their guests. Heaven and earth together would drip sweet dew equally on all people without regulation. Begin to make order and names arise. Names lead to more names - and to knowing when to stop. Tao\'s presence in this world is like valley streams flowing into rivers and seas.',
    'Knowing others is intelligent. Knowing yourself is enlightened. Conquering others takes force. Conquering yourself is true strength. Knowing what is enough is wealth. Forging ahead shows inner resolve. Hold your ground and you will last long. Die without perishing and your life will endure.',
    'Great Tao overflows. To the left to the right. All beings owe their life to it and do not depart from it. It acts without a name. It clothes and nourishes all beings but does not become their master. Enduring without desires, it may be called slight. All beings return to it, but it does not become their master. It may be called immense. By not making itself great, it can do great things.',
    'Hold the great elephant - the great image - and the world moves. Moves without danger in safety and peace. Music and sweets make passing guests pause. But the Tao emerges flavourless and bland. Look - you won\'t see it. Listen - you won\'t hear it. Use it - you will never use it up.',
    'To collect, first scatter. To weaken, first strengthen. To abolish, first establish. To conclude, first initiate. This is called subtle illumination. Soft and weak overcome stiff and strong. Fish cannot escape the deep pool. A country\'s sharpest weapons cannot be displayed.',
    'Tao endures without a name, yet nothing is left undone. If kings and lords could possess it, all beings would transform themselves. Transformed, they desire to create; I quiet them through nameless simplicity. Then there is no desire. No desire is serenity, and the world settles of itself.',
    'High Te? No Te! That\'s what Te is. Low Te doesn\'t lack Te; That\'s what Te is not. Those highest in Te take no action and don\'t need to act. Those lowest in Te take action and do need to act. Those highest in benevolence take action but don\'t need to act. Those highest in righteousness take action and do need to act. Those highest in propriety take action and if people don\'t reciprocate roll up their sleeves and throw them out. Therefore lose Tao and Te follows. Lose Te and benevolence follows. Lose benevolence and righteousness follows. Lose righteousness and propriety follows. Propriety dilutes loyalty and sincerity: Confusion begins. Foreknowledge glorifies the Tao: Stupidity sets in. And so the ideal person dwells in substance, not dilution, in reality, not glory, accepts one, rejects the other.',
    'Of old, these attained the One: Heaven attaining the One became clear. Earth attaining the One became stable. Spirits attaining the One became sacred. Valleys attaining the One became bountiful. Myriad beings attaining the One became fertile. Lords and kings attaining the One purified the world. If Heaven were not clear, it might split. If Earth were not stable, it might erupt. If spirits were not sacred, they might fade. If valleys were not bountiful, they might wither. If myriad beings were not fertile, they might perish. If rulers and lords were not noble, they might stumble. Therefore, noble has humble as its root, high has low as its foundation. Rulers and lords call themselves poor and lonely orphans. Isn\'t this using humility as a root? They use many carriages but have no carriage. They do not desire to glisten like jade but drop like a stone.',
    'Reversal is Tao\'s movement. Yielding is Tao\'s practice. All things originate from being. Being originates from non-being.',
    'The great scholar hearing the Tao tries to practice it. The middling scholar hearing the Tao, sometimes has it, sometimes not. The lesser scholar hearing the Tao has a good laugh. Without that laughter it wouldn\'t be Tao. Therefore these sayings: The bright road seems dark, the road forward seems to retreat, the level road seems rough. Great Te seems hollow. Great purity seems sullied. Pervasive Te seems deficient. Established Te seems furtive. Simple truths seem to change. The great square has no corners. The great vessel is finished late. The great sound is scarcely voiced. The great image has no form. Tao hides, no name. Yet Tao alone gets things done.',
    'Tao engenders one, one engenders two, two engenders three, three engenders the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things carry shade and embrace sunlight. Shade and sunlight, yin and yang, breath blending into harmony. Humans hate to be alone, poor, and hungry. Yet kings and princes use these words as titles. We gain by losing, lose by gaining. What others teach, I also teach: "A violent man does not die a natural death." This is the basis of my teaching.',
    'The softest thing in the world rides roughshod over the strongest. No-thing enters no-space. This teaches me the benefits of no-action. Teaching without words benefit without action - few in this world can attain this.',
    'Name or body: which is closer? Body or possessions: which means more? Gain or loss: which one hurts? Extreme love exacts a great price. Many possessions entail a heavy loss. Know what is enough - abuse nothing. Know when to stop - harm nothing. This is how to last for a long time.',
    'Great accomplishment seems unfinished but its use is continuous. Great fullness seems empty but in use is inexhaustible. Great straightness seems bent, great skill seems clumsy, great eloquence seems mute. Exertion overcomes cold. Calm overcomes heat. Pure calm is the norm under heaven.',
    'With Tao under heaven stray horses fertilize the fields. Without Tao under heaven warhorses are bred at the frontier. There is no greater calamity than not knowing what is enough. There is no greater fault than desire for success. Therefore, knowing that enough is enough is always enough.',
    'Without going out the door, know the world. Without peeping through the window, see heaven\'s Tao. The further you travel, the less you know. This is why the Sage knows without budging, identifies without looking, does without trying.',
    'Pursue knowledge, gain daily. Pursue Tao, lose daily. Lose and again lose, arrive at non-doing. Non-doing - and nothing not done. Take the entire world as nothing. Make the least effort, and the world escapes you.',
    'The Sage has no set heart. Ordinary people\'s hearts become the Sage\'s heart. People who are good I treat well. People who are not good I also treat well: Te as goodness. Trustworthy people I trust. Untrustworthy people I also trust. Te as trust. Sages create harmony under heaven blending their hearts with the world. Ordinary people fix their eyes and ears upon them, but Sages become the world\'s children.',
    'Emerge into life, enter death. Life is only the thirteen body parts. Death is only the thirteen body parts. Human life, moving towards death, is the same thirteen. Why is this? Because life gives life to substance. You have heard of people good at holding on to life. Walking overland they don\'t avoid rhinos and tigers. In battle they don\'t arm themselves. The rhino\'s horn finds nothing to gore, the tiger\'s claws find nothing to flay, weapons find nothing to pierce. Why is this? They have no mortal spot.',
    'Tao bears them, Te nurses them, events form them, energy completes them. Therefore the ten thousand beings honour Tao and respect Te. Tao is honoured Te is respected because they do not give orders but endure in their own nature. Therefore, Tao bears them and Te nurses them, rears them, raises them, shelters them, nurtures them, supports them, protects them. Bears them without owning them, helps them without coddling them, rears them without ruling them. This is called original Te.',
    'The world has a source: the world\'s mother. Once you have the mother, you know the children. Once you know the children, return to the mother. Your body dies. There is no danger. Block the passage, bolt the gate: No strain until your life ends. Open the passage, take charge of things: No relief until your life ends. Seeing the small is called brightness. Maintaining gentleness is called strength. Use this brightness to return to brightness. Don\'t cling to your body\'s woes. Then you can learn endurance.',
    'Having some knowledge when walking on the great Tao only brings fear. The great Tao is very smooth, but people like rough trails. The government is divided, fields are overgrown, granaries are empty, but the nobles clothes are gorgeous, their belts show off swords, and they are glutted with food and drink. Personal wealth is excessive. This is called thieves\' endowment, but it is not Tao.',
    'Well planted, not uprooted. Well embraced, never lost. Descendants will continue the ancestral rituals. Maintain oneself: Te becomes real. Maintain the family: Te becomes abundant. Maintain the community: Te becomes extensive. Maintain the country: Te becomes public. Maintain the world: Te becomes omnipresent. Therefore, through self contemplate self, through family contemplate family, through community contemplate community, through country contemplate country, through world contemplate world. How do I know the world? Like this!',
    'Be filled with Te, like a baby: Wasps, scorpions and vipers do not sting it. Fierce tigers do not stalk it. Birds of prey do not attack it. Bones weak, muscles soft, but its grasp is tight. It does not yet know union of male and female, but its sex is formed, its vital essence complete. It can scream all day and not get hoarse, its harmony is complete. Knowing harmony is called endurance. Knowing endurance is called illumination. Increasing life is called fortune. Mind controlling energy is called power. When beings prosper and grow old, call them not-Tao. Not-Tao soon ends.',
    'Those who know don\'t talk. Those who talk don\'t know. Block the passage, bolt the gate, blunt the sharp, untie the knot, blend with the light, become one with the dust - this is called original unity. It can\'t be embraced, it can\'t be escaped, it can\'t be helped, it can\'t be harmed, it can\'t be exalted, it can\'t be despised. Therefore it is revered under Heaven.',
    'Use the unexpected to govern the country, use surprise to wage war, use non-action to win the world. How do I know? Like this! The more prohibitions and rules, the poorer people become. The sharper people\'s weapons, the more they riot. The more skilled their techniques, the more grotesque their works. The more elaborate the laws, the more they commit crimes. Therefore the Sage says, I do nothing and people transform themselves. I enjoy serenity and people govern themselves. I cultivate emptiness and people become prosperous. I have no desires and people simplify themselves.',
    'If government is muted and muffled people are cool and refreshed. If government investigates and intrudes, people are worn down and hopeless. Bad fortune rests upon good fortune. Good luck hides within bad luck. Who knows how it will end? If there is no principle, principle reverts to disorder, good reverts to calamity, people\'s confusion hardens and lingers on. Therefore the Sage squares without cutting, corners without dividing, straightens without extending, shines without dazzling.',
    'Governing people and serving heaven is like living off the land. Living sparingly and responding quickly means accumulating Te. There is nothing that cannot be overcome. There is no limit. You can become the country and the country\'s mother, and nourish and extend it. This is called deep roots, firm base. This is the Tao of living long and seeing far.',
    'Govern big countries like you cook a little fish. When Tao harmonizes the world, demons lose their power. Not that demons lose their power, but their power does not harm people. Not that their power does not harm people, but the Sage does not harm people. If neither does harm, then Te flows and returns.',
    'A great nation flows down to be the world\'s pool, the female under heaven. In stillness the female constantly overcomes the male, in stillness takes the low place. Therefore a great nation lowers itself and wins over a small one. A small nation keeps itself low and wins over a great one. Sometimes becoming low wins, sometimes staying low wins. A great nation desires nothing more than to unite and protect people. A small nation desires nothing more than to enter the service of people. When both get what they wish the great one should be low.',
    'Tao is the mysterious center of all things, a treasure for those who are good, a refuge for those who are not. Beautiful words can be traded, noble deeds can enhance reputations, but if people lack them, why should they be rejected? When the son of Heaven is enthroned and the Three Ministers installed, presenting jade discs and four-horse chariots cannot compare to sitting still and offering the Tao. The ancients honoured this Tao. Didn\'t they say: Through it seekers find, through it the guilty escape? This is why Tao is honoured under Heaven.',
    'Act without acting. Serve without serving. Taste without tasting. Big, little, many, few. Repay hatred with Te. Map difficult with easy. Approach great through narrow. The most difficult things in the world must be accomplished through the easiest. The greatest things in the world must be accomplished through the smallest. Therefore the Sage never attempts great things and so accomplishes them. Quick promises mean little trust. Everything easy means great difficulty. Thus for the Sage everything is difficult, and so in the end nothing is difficult.',
    'At rest is easy to hold. Not yet impossible is easy to plan. Brittle is easy to break. Fine is easy to scatter. Create before it exists. Lead before it goes astray. A tree too big to embrace is born from a slender shoot. A nine-story rises from a pile of earth. A thousand-mile journey begins with a single step. Act and you ruin it. Grasp and you lose it. Therefore the Sage does not act and so does not ruin, does not grasp and so does not lose. People commonly ruin their work when they are near success. Proceed at the end as at the beginning and your work won\'t be ruined. Therefore the Sage desires no desires, prizes no prizes, studies no studies, and returns to what others pass by. The Sage helps all beings find their nature, but does not presume to act.',
    'Taoist rulers of old did not enlighten people but left them dull. People are difficult to govern because they are very clever. Therefore, ruling through cleverness leads to rebellion. Not leading through cleverness brings good fortune. Know these two things and understanding the enduring pattern. Understand the enduring pattern: This is called original Te. Original Te goes deep and far. All things reverse, return, and reach the great headwaters.',
    'Rivers and seas can rule the hundred valleys. Because they are good at lying low they are lords of the valleys. Therefore those who would be above must speak as if they are below. Those who would lead must speak as if they are behind. In this way the Sage dwells above and the people are not burdened. Dwells in front and they are not hindered. Therefore the whole world is delighted and unwearied. Since the Sage does not contend no one can contend with the Sage.',
    'Everyone under heaven calls my Tao great, and unlike anything else. It is great only because it is unlike anything else. If it were like anything else it would stretch and become thin. I have three treasures to maintain and conserve: the first is compassion. The second is frugality. The third is not presuming to be first under heaven. Compassion leads to courage. Frugality allows generosity. Not presuming to be first creates a lasting instrument. Nowadays, people reject compassion but want to be brave, reject frugality but want to be generous, reject humility and want to come first. This is death. Compassion: Attack with it and win. Defend with it and stand firm. Heaven aids and protects through compassion.',
    'The accomplished person is not aggressive. The good soldier is not hot tempered. The best conqueror does not engage the enemy. The most effective leader takes the lowest place. This is called the Te of not contending. This is called the power of the leader. This is called matching Heaven\'s ancient ideal.',
    'There is a saying in the army: I do not presume to be the master, but become the guest. I do not dare advance an inch, but retreat a foot. This is called moving without moving, rolling up sleeves without showing your arms, repelling without opposing, wielding without a weapon. There is no disaster greater than contempt for the enemy. Contempt for the enemy - what a treasure is lost! Therefore, when the fighting gets hot, those who grieve will conquer.',
    'My words are very easy to understand, very easy to practice. No one under heaven can understand them, no one can practice them. Words have ancestors, deeds have masters. If people don\'t understand this, they don\'t understand me. Few understand me, and that is my value. Therefore the Sage wears rough clothing and carries jade inside.',
    'Know not-knowing: supreme. Not know knowing: faulty. Only faulting faults is faultless. The Sage is faultless by faulting faults, and so is without fault.',
    'When people are not in awe of power, power becomes great. Do not intrude into their homes, do not make their lives weary. If you do not weary them, they will not become weary of you. Therefore the Sage has self-knowledge without self-display, self-love without personal pride, rejects one, accepts the other.',
    'Courage to dare kills, courage not to dare saves. One brings profit, one brings harm. Of these two, one is good, and one is harmful. Some are not favored by heaven. Who knows why? Even the wise consider it a difficult question. Heaven hates what it hates - who knows why! Even the Sage finds it difficult. Heaven\'s Tao does not contend but prevails, does not speak but responds, is not summoned but arrives, is utterly still but plans all actions. Heaven\'s net is wide, wide, loose - but nothing slips through.',
    'If people do not fear death, how dare you threaten them with death? But if people with a normal fear of death are about to do something vicious, and I could seize and execute them, who would dare? There is always an official executioner. Trying to take the executioner\'s place, is like trying to replace a master woodworker - few would not slice their own hands.',
    'People are hungry. When rulers tax grain people are hungry. People are rebellious. When rulers are active people are rebellious. People ignore death. When searching only for life\'s bounty people ignore death. Only those who do not strive after life truly respect life.',
    'Humans are born soft and weak. They die stiff and strong. The ten thousand plants and trees are born soft and tender, and die withered and sere. The stiff and strong are Death\'s companions. The soft and weak are Life\'s companions. Therefore the strongest armies do not conquer, the greatest trees are cut down. The strong and great sink down. The soft and weak rise up.',
    'Heaven\'s Tao is a stretched bow, pulling down on the top, pulling up on the bottom. If it\'s too much, cut. If it\'s not enough, add on to it: Heaven\'s Tao. The human route is not like this. Depriving the poor, offering to the rich. Who has a surplus and still offers it to the world? Only those with Tao. Therefore the Sage acts and expects nothing, accomplishes and does not linger, has no desire to seem worthy.',
    'Nothing in the world is soft and weak as water. But when attacking the hard and strong nothing can conquer so easily. Weak overcomes strong, soft overcomes hard. Everyone knows this, no one attains it. Therefore the Sage says: Accept a country\'s filth and become master of its sacred soil. Accept a country\'s ill fortune and become king under heaven. True words resemble their opposites.',
    'Appears great hatred and hatred will remain. How can this be good? Therefore the Sage holds the tally but does not judge people. Those who have Te control the tally. Those who lack Te collect their due. Heaven has no favourites but endures in good people.',
    'Small country, few people - hundreds of devices, but none are used. People ponder on death and don\'t travel far. They have carriages and boats, but no one goes on board. Weapons and armour, but no one brandishes them. They use knotted cords for counting. Sweet is their food, beautiful their clothes, peaceful their homes, delightful their customs. Neighboring countries are so close you can hear their chickens and dogs, but people grow old and die without needing to come and go.',
    'Sincere words and not pretty. Pretty words are not sincere. Good people do not quarrel. Quarrelsome people are not good. The wise are not learned. The learned are not wise. The Sage is not acquisitive - has enough by doing for others, has even more by giving to others. Heaven\'s Tao benefits and does not harm. The Sage\'s Tao acts and does not contend.',

  'Derek Lin': [
    'The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth. The named is the mother of myriad things. Thus, constantly free of desire one observes its wonders. Constantly filled with desire one observes its manifestations. These two emerge together but differ in name. The unity is said to be the mystery. Mystery of mysteries, the door to all wonders.',
    'When the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When it knows good as good, evil arises. Thus being and non-being produce each other. Difficult and easy bring about each other. Long and short reveal each other. High and low support each other. Music and voice harmonize each other. Front and back follow each other. Therefore the sages: Manage the work of detached actions. Conduct the teaching of no words. They work with myriad things but do not control. They create but do not possess. They act but do not presume. They succeed but do not dwell on success. It is because they do not dwell on success that it never goes away.',
    'Do not glorify the achievers so the people will not squabble. Do not treasure goods that are hard to obtain so the people will not become thieves. Do not show the desired things so their hearts will not be confused. Thus the governance of the sage: empties their hearts, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones. Let the people have no cunning and no greed so those who scheme will not dare to meddle. Act without contrivance and nothing will be beyond control.',
    'The Tao is empty. Utilize it, it is not filled up. So deep! It seems to be the source of all things. It blunts the sharpness, unravels the knots, dims the glare, mixes the dusts. So indistinct! It seems to exist. I do not know whose offspring it is. Its image is the predecessor of God.',
    'Heaven and Earth are without bias and regard myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is without bias and regards people as straw dogs. The space between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows? Empty, and yet never exhausted. It moves, and produces more. Too many words hasten failure. Cannot compare to keeping quiet.',
    'The valley spirit, undying, is called the mystical female. The gateway of the mystical female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. It flows continuously, barely perceptible. Utilize it, it is never exhausted.',
    'Heaven and earth are everlasting. The reason heaven and earth can last forever is that they do not exist for themselves. Thus they can last forever. Therefore the sage: Places himself last but ends up in front. Is outside of himself and yet survives. Isn\'t it all due to his selflessness? That\'s how he can achieve his own goals.',
    'The highest goodness resembles water. Water greatly benefits myriad things without contention. It stays in places that people dislike, therefore it is similar to the Tao. Dwelling at the right place. Heart with great depth. Giving with great kindness. Words with great integrity. Governing with great administration. Handling with great capability. Moving with great timing. Because it does not contend, it is therefore beyond reproach.',
    'Holding a cup and overfilling it cannot be as good as stopping short. Pounding a blade and sharpening it cannot be kept for long. Gold and jade fill up the room, no one is able to protect them. Wealth and position bring arrogance and leave upon oneself disasters. When achievement is completed, fame attained, withdraw oneself. This is the Tao of Heaven.',
    'In holding the soul and embracing oneness, can one be without straying? In concentrating the energy and reaching relaxation, can one be like an infant? In cleaning away the worldly view, can one be without imperfections? In loving the people and ruling the nation, can one be without manipulation? In the heavenly gate\'s opening and closing, can one hold to the feminine principle? In understanding clearly all directions, can one be without intellectuality? Bearing it, rearing it. Bearing without possession. Achieving without arrogance. Raising without domination. This is called the mystic virtue.',
    'Thirty spokes join in one hub. In its emptiness, there is the function of a vehicle. Mix clay to create a container. In its emptiness, there is the function of a container. Cut open doors and windows to create a room. In its emptiness, there is the function of a room. Therefore, that which exists is used to create benefit. That which is empty is used to create functionality.',
    'The five colors make one blind in the eyes. The five sounds make one deaf in the ears. The five flavors make one tasteless in the mouth. Racing and hunting make one wild in the heart. Goods that are difficult to acquire make one cause damage. Therefore the sage cares for the stomach and not the eyes. That\'s why he discards the other and takes this.',
    'Favor and disgrace make one fearful. The greatest misfortune is the self. What does "favor and disgrace make one fearful" mean? Favor is high, disgrace is low. Having it makes one fearful. Losing it makes one fearful. This is "favor and disgrace make one fearful" What does "the greatest misfortune is the self" mean? The reason I have great misfortune is that I have the self. If I have no self, what misfortune do I have? So one who values the self as the world can be given the world. One who loves the self as the world can be entrusted with the world.',
    'Look at it, it cannot be seen. It is called colorless. Listen to it, it cannot be heard. It is called noiseless. Reach for it, it cannot be held. It is called formless. These three cannot be completely unraveled so they are combined into one. Above it, not bright. Below it, not dark. Continuing endlessly, cannot be named. It returns back into nothingness. Thus it is called the form of the formless. The image of the imageless. This is called enigmatic. Confront it, its front cannot be seen. Follow it, its back cannot be seen. Wield the Tao of the ancients to manage the existence of today. One can know the ancient beginning. It is called the Tao axiom.',
    'The Tao masters of antiquity, subtle wonders through mystery. Depths that cannot be discerned because one cannot discern them. Therefore one is forced to describe the appearance. Hesitant, like crossing a wintry river. Cautious, like fearing four neighbors. Solemn, like a guest. Loose, like ice about to melt. Genuine, like plain wood. Open, like a valley. Opaque, like muddy water. Who can be muddled yet desist. In stillness gradually become clear? Who can be serene yet persist. In motion gradually come alive? One who holds this Tao does not wish to be overfilled. Because one is not overfilled therefore one can preserve and not create anew.',
    'Attain the ultimate emptiness. Hold on to the truest tranquility. The myriad things are all active. I therefore watch their return. Everything flourishes; each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called tranquility. Tranquility is called returning to one\'s nature. Returning to one\'s nature is called constancy. Knowing constancy is called clarity. Not knowing constancy, one recklessly causes trouble. Knowing constancy is acceptance. Acceptance is impartiality. Impartiality is sovereign. Sovereign is heaven. Heaven is Tao. Tao is eternal. The self is no more, without danger.',
    'The highest rulers, people do not know they have them. The next level, people love them and praise them. The next level, people fear them. The next level, people despise them. The rulers\' trust is insufficient, have no trust in them. Proceeding calmly, valuing their words. Task accomplished, matter settled. The people all say, "We did it naturally."',
    'The great Tao fades away. There is benevolence and justice. Intelligence comes forth. There is great deception. The six relations are not harmonious. There is filial piety and kind affection. The country is in confused chaos. There are loyal ministers.',
    'Discontinue sagacity, abandon knowledge. The people benefit a hundred times. Discontinue benevolence, abandon righteousness. The people return to piety and charity. Discontinue cunning, discard profit. Bandits and thieves no longer exist. These three things are superficial and insufficient. Thus this teaching has its place: Show plainness, hold simplicity. Reduce selfishness, decrease desires.',
    'Cease learning, no more worries. Respectful response and scornful response: How much is the difference? Goodness and evil: How much do they differ? What the people fear, I cannot be unafraid. So desolate! How limitless it is! The people are excited as if enjoying a great feast. As if climbing up to the terrace in spring. I alone am quiet and uninvolved like an infant not yet smiling. So weary, like having no place to return. The people all have surplus while I alone seem lacking. I have the heart of a fool indeed - so ignorant! Ordinary people are bright, I alone am muddled. Ordinary people are scrutinizing, I alone am obtuse. So tranquil, like the ocean. So moving, as if without limits. The people all have goals and I alone am stubborn and lowly. I alone am different from them and value the nourishing mother.',
    'The appearance of great virtue follows only the Tao. The Tao, as a thing seems indistinct, seems unclear. So unclear, so indistinct. Within it there is image. So indistinct, so unclear. Within it there is substance. So deep, so profound. Within it there is essence. Its essence is supremely real. Within it there is faith. From ancient times to the present its name never departs. To observe the source of all things. How do I know the nature of the source? With this.',
    'Yield and remain whole. Bend and remain straight. Be low and become filled. Be worn out and become renewed. Have little and receive. Have much and be confused. Therefore the sage holds to the one as an example for the world. Without flaunting oneself - and so is seen clearly. Without presuming oneself - and so is distinguished. Without praising oneself - and so has merit. Without boasting about oneself - and so is lasting. Because he does not contend, the world cannot contend with him. What the ancients called "the one who yields and remains whole." Were they speaking empty words? Sincerity becoming whole, and returning to oneself.',
    'Sparse speech is natural. Thus strong wind does not last all morning. Sudden rain does not last all day. What makes this so? Heaven and earth. Even heaven and earth cannot make it last. How can humans? Thus those who follow the Tao, are with the Tao. Those who follow virtue, are with virtue. Those who follow loss, are with loss. Those who are with the Tao, the Tao is also pleased to have them. Those who are with virtue, virtue is also pleased to have them. Those who are with loss, loss is also pleased to have them. Those who do not trust sufficiently, others have no trust in them.',
    'Those who are on tiptoes cannot stand. Those who straddle cannot walk. Those who flaunt themselves are not clear. Those who presume themselves are not distinguished. Those who praise themselves have no merit. Those who boast about themselves do not last. Those with the Tao call such things leftover food or tumors. They despise them. Thus, those who possess the Tao do not engage in them.',
    'There is something formlessly created. Born before Heaven and Earth. So silent! So ethereal! Independent and changeless, circulating and ceaseless. It can be regarded as the mother of the world. I do not know its name. Identifying it, I call it "Tao." Forced to describe it, I call it great. Great means passing. Passing means receding. Receding means returning. Therefore the Tao is great, heaven is great, earth is great. The sovereign is also great. There are four greats in the universe and the sovereign occupies one of them. Humans follow the laws of Earth. Earth follows the laws of Heaven. Heaven follows the laws of Tao. Tao follows the laws of nature.',
    'Heaviness is the root of lightness. Quietness is the master of restlessness. Therefore the sage travels the entire day without leaving the heavy supplies. Even though there are luxurious sights he is composed and transcends beyond. How can the lord of ten thousand chariots apply himself lightly to the world? To be light is to lose one\'s root. To be restless is to lose one\'s mastery.',
    'Good traveling does not leave tracks. Good speech does not seek faults. Good reckoning does not use counters. Good closure needs no bar and yet cannot be opened. Good knot needs no rope and yet cannot be untied. Therefore sages often save others and so do not abandon anyone. They often save things and so do not abandon anything. This is called following enlightenment. Therefore the good person is the teacher of the bad person. The bad person is the resource of the good person. The one who does not value his teachers and does not love his resources, although intelligent, he is greatly confused. This is called the essential wonder.',
    'Know the masculine, hold to the feminine. Be the watercourse of the world. Being the watercourse of the world the eternal virtue does not depart. Return to the state of the infant. Know the white, hold to the black. Be the standard of the world. Being the standard of the world the eternal virtue does not deviate. Return to the state of the boundless. Know the honor, hold to the dishonor. Be the valley of the world. Being the valley of the world the eternal virtue shall be sufficient. Return to the state of plain wood. Plain wood splits, then becomes tools. The sages utilize them and then become leaders. Thus the greater whole is undivided.',
    'Those who wish to take the world and control it, I see that they cannot succeed. The world is a sacred instrument, one cannot control it. The one who controls it will fail. The one who grasps it will lose. Because all things: either lead or follow, either blow hot or cold, either have strength or weakness, either have ownership or take by force. Therefore the sage: eliminates extremes, eliminates excess, eliminates arrogance.',
    'The one who uses the Tao to advise the ruler does not dominate the world with soldiers. Such methods tend to be returned. The place where the troops camp, thistles and thorns grow. Following the great army there must be an inauspicious year. A good commander achieves result, then stops, and does not dare reaching for domination. Achieves result but does not brag. Achieves result but does not flaunt. Achieves result but is not arrogant. Achieves result but only out of necessity. Achieves result but does not dominate. Things become strong and then get old. This is called contrary to the Tao. That which is contrary to the Tao soon ends.',
    'A strong military, a tool of misfortune. All things detest it. Therefore, those who possess the Tao avoid it. Honorable gentlemen, while at home, value the left. When deploying the military, value the right. The military is a tool of misfortune, not the tool of honorable gentlemen. When using it out of necessity calm detachment should be above all. Victorious but without glory. Those who glorify are delighting in the killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions upon the world. Auspicious events favor the left. Inauspicious events favor the right. The lieutenant general is positioned to the left. The major general is positioned to the right. We say that they are treated as if in a funeral. The multitude who have been killed should be mourned with sadness. Victory in war should be treated as a funeral.',
    'The Tao, eternally nameless. Its simplicity, although imperceptible, cannot be treated by the world as subservient. If a sovereign can hold on to it all will follow by themselves. The heaven and earth, together harmoniously will rain sweet dew. People won\'t need to force it, it will adjust by itself. In the beginning of creation, there were names. Names came to exist everywhere. One should know when to stop. Knowing when to stop, thus avoiding danger. The existence of the Tao in the world is like streams in the valley into rivers and the ocean.',
    'Those who understand others are intelligent. Those who understand themselves are enlightened. Those who overcome others have strength. Those who overcome themselves are powerful. Those who know contentment are wealthy. Those who proceed vigorously have willpower. Those who do not lose their base endure. Those who die but do not perish have longevity.',
    'The great Tao is like a flood. It can flow to the left or to the right. The myriad things depend on it for life, but it never stops. It achieves its work, but does not take credit. It clothes and feeds myriad things, but does not rule over them. Ever desiring nothing it can be named insignificant. Myriad things return to it but it does not rule over them. It can be named great. Even in the end, it does not regard itself as great. That is how it can achieve its greatness.',
    'Hold the great image, the world will come. They come without harm, in harmonious peace. Music and food, passing travelers stop. The Tao that is spoken out of the mouth is bland and without flavor. Look at it, it cannot be seen. Listen to it, it cannot be heard. Use it, it cannot be exhausted.',
    'If one wishes to shrink it, one must first expand it. If one wishes to weaken it, one must first strengthen it. If one wishes to discard it, one must first promote it. If one wishes to seize it, one must first give it. This is called subtle clarity. The soft and weak overcomes the tough and strong. Fish cannot leave the depths. The sharp instruments of the state cannot be shown to the people.',
    'The Tao is constant in non-action yet there is nothing it does not do. If the sovereign can hold on to this all things shall transform themselves. Transformed, yet wishing to achieve. I shall restrain them with the simplicity of the nameless. The simplicity of the nameless they shall be without desire. Without desire, using stillness the world shall steady itself.',
    'High virtue is not virtuous, therefore it has virtue. Low virtue never loses virtue, therefore it has no virtue. High virtue takes no contrived action and acts without agenda. Low virtue takes contrived action and acts with agenda. High benevolence takes contrived action and acts without agenda. High righteousness takes contrived action and acts with agenda. High etiquette takes contrived action and upon encountering no response uses arms to pull others. Therefore, the Tao is lost, and then virtue. Virtue is lost, and then benevolence. Benevolence is lost, and then righteousness. Righteousness is lost, and then etiquette. Those who have etiquette are a thin shell of loyalty and sincerity and the beginning of chaos. Those with foreknowledge are the flowers of the Tao and the beginning of ignorance. Therefore the great person: abides in substance, and does not dwell on the thin shell, abides in the real, and does not dwell on the flower. Thus they discard that and take this.',
    'Those that attained oneness since ancient times: The sky attained oneness and thus clarity. The earth attained oneness and thus tranquility. The gods attained oneness and thus divinity. The valley attained oneness and thus abundance. The myriad things attained oneness and thus life. The rulers attained oneness and became the standard for the world. These are all from oneness. The sky, lacking clarity, would break apart. The earth, lacking tranquility, would erupt. The gods, lacking divinity, would vanish. The valley, lacking abundance, would wither. Myriad things, lacking life, would be extinct. The rulers, lacking standard, would be toppled. Therefore, the honored uses the lowly as basis. The higher uses the lower as foundation. Thus the rulers call themselves alone, bereft, and unworthy. Is this not using the lowly as basis? Is it not so? Therefore, the ultimate honor is no honor. Do not wish to be shiny like jade. Be dull like rocks.',
    'The returning is the movement of the Tao. The weak is the utilization of the Tao. The myriad things of the world are born of being. Being is born of non-being.',
    'Higher people hear of the Tao, they diligently practice it. Average people hear of the Tao, they sometimes keep it and sometimes lose it. Lower people hear of the Tao, they laugh loudly at it. If they do not laugh, it would not be the Tao. Therefore a proverb has the following: The clear Tao appears unclear. The advancing Tao appears to retreat. The smooth Tao appears uneven. High virtue appears like a valley. Great integrity appears like disgrace. Encompassing virtue appears insufficient. Building virtue appears inactive. True substance appears inconstant. The great square has no corners. The great vessel is late in completion. The great music is imperceptible in sound. The great image has no form. The Tao is hidden and nameless. Yet it is only the Tao that excels in giving and completing everything.',
    'Tao produces one. One produces two. Two produce three. Three produce myriad things. Myriad things, backed by yin and embracing yang, achieve harmony by integrating their energy. What the people dislike are alone, bereft, and unworthy. But the rulers call themselves with these terms. So with all things, appear to take loss but benefit, or receive benefit but lose. What the ancients taught I will also teach. The violent one cannot have a natural death. I will use this as the principal of teachings.',
    'The softest things of the world override the hardest things of the world. That which has no substance enters into that which has no openings. From this I know the benefits of non-attached actions. The teaching without words, the benefits of actions without attachment, are rarely matched in the world.',
    'Fame or the self, which is dearer? The self or wealth, which is greater? Gain or loss, which is more painful? Thus excessive love must lead to great spending. Excessive hoarding must lead to heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace. Knowing when to stop avoids danger. Thus one can endure indefinitely.',
    'Great perfection seems flawed. Its function is without failure. Great fullness seems empty. Its function is without exhaustion. Great straightness seems bent. Great skill seems inept. Great eloquence seems inarticulate. Movement overcomes cold. Stillness overcomes heat. Clear quietness is the standard of the world.',
    'When the world has the Tao fast horses are retired to fertilize the grounds. When the world lacks the Tao warhorses must give birth on the battlefield. There is no crime greater than greed. No disaster greater than discontentment. No fault greater than avarice. Thus the satisfaction of contentment is the lasting satisfaction.',
    'Without going out the door, know the world. Without peering out the window, see the Heavenly Tao. The further one goes the less one knows. Therefore the sage knows without going, names without seeing, achieves without striving.',
    'Pursue knowledge, daily gain. Pursue Tao, daily loss. Loss and more loss until one reaches non-action. With non-action, there is nothing one cannot do. Take the world by constantly applying non-interference. The one who interferes is not qualified to take the world.',
    'The sages have no constant mind. They take the mind of the people as their mind. Those who are good, I am good to them. Those who are not good, I am also good to them. Thus the virtue of goodness. Those who believe, I believe them. Those who do not believe, I also believe them. Thus the virtue of belief. The sages live in the world. They cautiously merge their mind for the world. The people all pay attention with their ears and eyes. The sages care for them as children.',
    'Coming into life, entering death. The followers of life, three in ten. The followers of death, three in ten. Those whose lives are moved toward death, also three in ten. Why? Because they live lives of excess. I\'ve heard of those who are good at cultivating life. Traveling on the road, they do not encounter rhinos or tigers. Entering into an army, they are not harmed by weapons. Rhinos have nowhere to thrust their horns. Tigers have nowhere to clasp their claws. Soldiers have nowhere to lodge their blades. Why? Because they have no place for death.',
    'Tao produces them. Virtue raises them. Things shape them. Forces perfect them. Therefore all things respect the Tao and value virtue. The respect for Tao, the value of virtue. Not due to command but to constant nature. Thus Tao produces them. Virtue raises them, grows them, educates them, perfects them, matures them, nurtures them, protects them. Produces but does not possess. Acts but does not flaunt. Nurtures but does not dominate. This is called mystic virtue.',
    'The world has a beginning. We regard it as the mother of the world. Having its mother we can know her children. Knowing her children, still holding on to the mother. Live without danger all through life. Close the mouth, shut the doors. Live without toil all through life. Open the mouth, meddle in the affairs. Live without salvation all through life. Seeing details is called clarity. Holding on to the soft is called strength. Utilize the light. Return to the clarity. Leaving no disasters for the self. This is called following constancy.',
    'If I have a little knowledge, walking on the great Tao I fear only to deviate from it. The great Tao is broad and plain but people like the side paths. The courts are corrupt, the fields are barren, the warehouses are empty. Officials wear fineries, carry sharp swords, fill up on drinks and food, acquire excessive wealth. This is called robbery. It is not the Tao!',
    'The well-established cannot be uprooted. The well-grasped does not slip away. Generation after generation carries out the ancestor worship without break. Cultivate it in yourself and virtue will be real. Cultivate it in the family and virtue will overflow. Cultivate it in the town and virtue will be great. Cultivate it in the country and virtue will abundant. Cultivate it in the world and virtue will be everywhere. Therefore, take yourself and observe yourself. Take the family and observe the family. Take the town and observe the town. Take the country and observe the country. Take the world and observe the world. How do I know the world as it is? By this.',
    'Those who hold an abundance of virtue are similar to newborn infants. Poisonous insects do not sting them. Wild beasts do not claw them. Birds of prey do not attack them. Their bones are weak, tendons are soft, but their grasp is firm. They do not know of sexual union but can manifest arousal due to the optimum of essence. They can cry the whole day and yet not be hoarse due to the optimum of harmony. Knowing harmony is said to be constancy. Knowing constancy is said to be clarity. Excessive vitality is said to be inauspicious. Mind overusing energy is said to be aggressive. Things become strong and then grow old. This is called contrary to the Tao. That which is contrary to the Tao will soon perish.',
    'Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know. Close the mouth. Shut the doors. Blunt the sharpness. Unravel the knots. Dim the glare. Mix the dust. This is called mystic oneness. They cannot obtain this and be closer. They cannot obtain this and be distant. They cannot obtain this and be benefited. They cannot obtain this and be harmed. They cannot obtain this and be valued. They cannot obtain this and be degraded. Therefore, they become honored by the world.',
    'Govern a country with upright integrity. Deploy the military with surprise tactics. Take the world with non-interference. How do I know this is so? With the following: When there are many restrictions in the world the people become more impoverished. When people have many sharp weapons the country becomes more chaotic. When people have many clever tricks more strange things occur. The more laws are posted the more robbers and thieves there are. Therefore the sage says: I take minimal action, and the people transform themselves. I prefer quiet, and the people right themselves. I do not interfere, and the people enrich themselves. I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves.',
    'When governing is lackluster the people are simple and honest. When governing is scrutinizing the people are shrewd and crafty. Misfortune is what fortune depends upon. Fortune is where misfortune hides beneath. Who knows their ultimate end? They have no determined outcome. Rightness reverts to become strange. Goodness reverts to become wicked. The confusion of people has lasted many long days. Therefore the sages are: Righteous without being scathing. Incorruptible without being piercing. Straightforward without being ruthless. Illuminated without being flashy.',
    'In governing people and serving Heaven there is nothing like conservation. Only with conservation is it called submitting early. Submitting early is called emphasis on accumulating virtues. Accumulating virtues means there is nothing one cannot overcome. When there is nothing that one cannot overcome one\'s limits are unknown. The limitations being unknown, one can possess sovereignty. With this mother principle of power, one can be everlasting. This is called deep roots and firm foundation. The Tao of longevity and lasting vision.',
    'Ruling a large country is like cooking a small fish. Using the Tao to manage the world its demons have no power. Not only do its demons have no power, its gods do not harm people. Not only do its gods not harm people, the sages also do not harm people. They both do no harm to one another so virtue merges and returns.',
    'The large country is like the lowest river. The converging point of the world. The receptive female of the world. The female always overcomes the male with serenity. Using serenity as the lower position. Thus if the large country is lower than the small country then it can take the small country. If the small country is lower than the large country then it can be taken by the large country. Thus one uses the lower position to take. The other uses the lower position to be taken. The large country only wishes to gather and protect people. The small country only wishes to join and serve people. So that both obtain what they wish the larger one should assume the lower position.',
    'The Tao is the wonder of all things. The treasure of the kind person. The protection of the unkind person. Admirable words can win the public\'s respect. Admirable actions can improve people. Those who are unkind, how can they be abandoned? Therefore, when crowning the Emperor and install the three ministers, although there is the offering of jade before four horses, none of it can compare to being seated in this Tao. Why did the ancients value this Tao so much? Is it not said that those who seek will find, and those with guilt will not be faulted? Therefore, it is the greatest value in the world.',
    'Act without action. Manage without meddling. Taste without tasting. Great, small, many, few. Respond to hatred with virtue. Plan difficult tasks through the simplest tasks. Achieve large tasks through the smallest tasks. The difficult tasks of the world must be handled through the simple tasks. The large tasks of the world must be handled through the small tasks. Therefore, sages never attempt great deeds all through life thus they can achieve greatness. One who makes promises lightly must deserve little trust. One who sees many easy tasks must encounter much difficulty. Therefore, sages regard things as difficult so they never encounter difficulties all through life.',
    'When it is peaceful, it is easy to maintain. When it shows no signs, it is easy to plan. When it is fragile, it is easy to break. When it is small, it is easy to scatter. Act on it when it has not yet begun. Treat it when it is not yet chaotic. A tree thick enough to embrace grows from the tiny sapling. A tower of nine levels starts from the dirt heap. A journey of a thousand miles begins beneath the feet. The one who meddles will fail. The one who grasps will lose. Therefore, sages do not meddle and thus do not fail. They do not grasp and thus do not lose. People, in handling affairs often come close to completion and fail. If they are as careful in the end as the beginning then they would have no failure. Therefore, sages desire not to desire. They do not value goods that are hard to acquire. They learn to unlearn. To redeem the fault of the people. To assist the nature of all things without daring to meddle.',
    'Those of ancient times who were adept at the Tao used it not to make people brighter, but to keep them simple. The difficulty in governing people is due to their excessive cleverness. Therefore, using cleverness to govern the state is being a thief of the state. Not using cleverness to govern the state is being a blessing of the state. Know that these two are both standards. Always knowing these standards is called Mystic Virtue. Mystic Virtue is so profound, so far-reaching it goes opposite to material things. Then it reaches great congruence.',
    'Rivers and oceans can be the kings of a hundred valleys. Because of their goodness in staying low, so they can be the kings of a hundred valleys. Thus if sages wish to be over people they must speak humbly to them. If they wish to be in front of people they must place themselves behind them. Thus the sages are positioned above but the people do not feel burdened. They are positioned in front but the people do not feel harmed. Thus the world is glad to push them forward without resentment. Because they do not contend, so the world cannot contend with them.',
    'Everyone in the world calls my Tao great as if it is beyond compare. It is only because of its greatness that it seems beyond compare. If it can be compared it would already be insignificant long ago. I have three treasures. I hold on to them and protect them. The first is called compassion. The second is called conservation. The third is called not daring to be ahead in the world. Compassionate, thus able to have courage. Conserving, thus able to reach widely. Not daring to be ahead in the world, thus able to assume leadership. Now if one has courage but discards compassion, reaches widely but discards conservation, goes ahead but discards being behind, then death! If one fights with compassion, then victory. With defense, then security. Heaven shall save them and with compassion guard them.',
    'The great generals are not warlike. The great warriors do not get angry. Those who are good at defeating enemies do not engage them. Those who are good at managing people lower themselves. It is called the virtue of non-contention. It is called the power of managing people. It is called being harmonious with heaven, the ultimate principle of the ancients.',
    'In using the military, there is a saying: I dare not be the host, but prefer to be the guest. I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to withdraw a foot. This is called marching in formation without formation. Raising arms without arms. Grappling enemies without enemies. Holding weapons without weapons. There is no greater disaster than to underestimate the enemy. Underestimating the enemy almost made me lose my treasures. So when evenly matched armies meet, the side that is compassionate shall win.',
    'My words are easy to understand, easy to practice. The world cannot understand, cannot practice. My words have basis. My actions have principle. People do not understand this therefore they do not understand me. Those who understand me are few, thus I am highly valued. Therefore the sage wears plain clothes but holds jade.',
    'To know that you do not know is highest. To not know but think you know is flawed. Only when one recognizes the fault as a fault can one be without fault. The sages are without fault because they recognize the fault as a fault. That is why they are without fault.',
    'When people no longer fear force they bring about greater force. Do not limit their place. Do not reject their livelihood. Because the ruler does not reject them therefore they do not reject the ruler. Therefore the sages: Know themselves but do not glorify themselves. Respect themselves but do not praise themselves. Thus they discard that and take this.',
    'The bold in daring will be killed. The bold in not daring will survive. Of these two, one may benefit, the other may harm. The one hated by heaven - who knows the reason? Even the sages still find this difficult. The Tao of heaven: Does not contend and yet excels in winning. Does not speak and yet excels in responding. Is not summoned and yet comes on its own. Is unhurried and yet excels in planning. The heavenly net is vast, loose, and yet does not let anything slip through.',
    'People do not fear death. How can they be threatened with death? If people are made to constantly fear death then those who act unlawfully I can capture and kill them. Who would dare? There exists a master executioner that kills. If we substitute for the master executioner to kill it is like substituting for the great carpenter to cut. Those who substitute for the great carpenter to cut, it is rare that they do not hurt their own hands.',
    'The people\'s hunger is due to the excess of their ruler\'s taxation, so they starve. The people\'s difficulty in being governed is due to the meddling of their ruler, so they are difficult to govern. The people\'s disregard for death is due to the glut in their ruler\'s pursuit of life, so they disregard death. Therefore those who do not strive for living are better than those who value living.',
    'While alive, the body is soft and pliant. When dead, it is hard and rigid. All living things, grass and trees, while alive, are soft and supple. When dead, become dry and brittle. Thus that which is hard and stiff is the follower of death. That which is soft and yielding is the follower of life. Therefore, an inflexible army will not win. A strong tree will be cut down. The big and forceful occupy a lowly position while the soft and pliant occupy a higher place.',
    'The Tao of heaven is like drawing a bow. Lower that which is high, raise that which is low. Reduce that which is excessive, add to that which is insufficient. The Tao of heaven reduces the excessive and adds to the insufficient. The Tao of people is not so. Reducing the insufficient in order to offer to the excessive. Who can offer their excess to the world? Only those who have the Tao. Therefore sages act without conceit, achieve without claiming credit. They do not wish to display their virtue.',
    'Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing is better at overcoming the hard and strong. This is because nothing can replace it. That the weak overcomes the strong and the soft overcomes the hard, everybody in the world knows but cannot put into practice. Therefore sages say: The one who accepts the humiliation of the state is called its master. The one who accepts the misfortune of the state becomes king of the world. The truth seems like the opposite.',
    'After settling a great dispute there must be remaining resentments. How can this be considered good? Therefore the sage holds the left part of the contract but does not demand payment from the other person. Those who have virtue hold the contract. Those without virtue hold the collections. The Heavenly Tao has no favorites. It constantly gives to the kind people.',
    'Small country, few people. Let them have many weapons but not use them. Let the people regard death seriously and not migrate far away. Although they have boats and chariots they have no need to take them. Although they have armors and weapons they have no need to display them. Let the people return to tying knots and using them. Savor their food, admire their clothes. Content in their homes, happy in their customs. Neighboring countries see one another, hear the sounds of roosters and dogs from one another. The people, until they grow old and die do not go back and forth with one another.',
    'True words are not beautiful. Beautiful words are not true. Those who are good do not debate. Those who debate are not good. Those who know are not broad of knowledge. Those who are broad of knowledge do not know. Sages do not accumulate. The more they assist others, the more they possess. The more they give to others, the more they gain. The Tao of heaven benefits and does not harm. The Tao of sages assists and does not contend.',
