  "Stephen Mitchell": [
    "The tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao, the name that can be named is not the eternal Name. The unnamable is the eternally real. Naming is the origin of all material things. Free from desire, you realize the mystery. Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations. Yet mystery and manifestations arise from the same source. This source is called darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gateway to all understanding.",
    "When people see some things as beautiful, other things become ugly. When people see some things as good, other things become bad. Being and non-being create each other. Difficult and easy support each other. Long and short define each other. High and low depend on each other. Before and after follow each other. Therefore the Master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything. Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go. She has but doesn't possess, acts but doesn't expect. When her work is done, she forgets it. That is why it lasts forever.",
    "If you overesteem great men, people become powerless. If you overvalue possessions, people begin to steal. The Master leads by emptying people's minds and filling their cores, by weakening their ambition and toughening their resolve. He helps people lose everything they know, everything they desire, and creates confusion in those who think that they know. Practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place.",
    "The Tao is like a well: used but never used up. It is like the eternal void: filled with infinite possibilities. It is hidden but always present. I don't know who gave birth to it. It is older than God.",
    "The Tao doesn't take sides; it gives birth to both good and evil. The Master doesn't take sides; she welcomes both saints and sinners. The Tao is like a bellows: it is empty yet infinitely capable. The more you use it, the more it produces; the more you talk of it, the less you understand. Hold on to the center.",
    "The Tao is called the Great Mother: empty yet inexhaustible, it gives birth to infinite worlds. It is always present within you. You can use it any way you want.",
    "The Tao is infinite, eternal. Why is it eternal? It was never born; thus it can never die. Why is it infinite? It has no desires for itself; thus it is present for all beings. The Master stays behind; that is why she is ahead. She is detached from all things; that is why she is one with them. Because she has let go of herself, she is perfectly fulfilled.",
    "The supreme good is like water, which nourishes all things without trying to. It is content with the low places that people disdain. Thus it is like the Tao. In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don't try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present. When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everybody will respect you.",
    "Fill your bowl to the brim and it will spill. Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt. Chase after money and security and your heart will never unclench. Care about people's approval and you will be their prisoner. Do your work, then step back. The only path to serenity.",
    "Can you coax your mind from its wandering and keep to the original oneness? Can you let your body become supple as a newborn child's? Can you cleanse your inner vision until you see nothing but the light? Can you love people and lead them without imposing your will? Can you deal with the most vital matters by letting events take their course? Can you step back from your own mind and thus understand all things? Giving birth and nourishing, having without possessing, acting with no expectations, leading and not trying to control: this is the supreme virtue.",
    "We join spokes together in a wheel, but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move. We shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want. We hammer wood for a house, but it is the inner space that makes it livable. We work with being, but non-being is what we use.",
    "Colors blind the eye. Sounds deafen the ear. Flavors numb the taste. Thoughts weaken the mind. Desires wither the heart. The Master observes the world but trusts his inner vision. He allows things to come and go. His heart is open as the sky.",
    "Success is as dangerous as failure. Hope is as hollow as fear. What does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure? Whether you go up the ladder or down it, your position is shaky. When you stand with your two feet on the ground, you will always keep your balance. What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear? Hope and fear are both phantoms that arise from thinking of the self. When we don't see the self as self, what do we have to fear? See the world as your self. Have faith in the way things are. Love the world as your self; then you can care for all things.",
    "Look, and it can't be seen. Listen, and it can't be heard. Reach, and it can't be grasped. Above, it isn't bright. Below, it isn't dark. Seamless, unnamable, it returns to the realm of nothing. Form that includes all forms, image without an image, subtle, beyond all conception. Approach it and there is no beginning; follow it and there is no end. You can't know it, but you can be it, at ease in your own life. Just realize where you come from: this is the essence of wisdom.",
    "The ancient Masters were profound and subtle. Their wisdom was unfathomable. There is no way to describe it; all we can describe is their appearance. They were careful as someone crossing an iced-over stream. Alert as a warrior in enemy territory. Courteous as a guest. Fluid as melting ice. Shapable as a block of wood. Receptive as a valley. Clear as a glass of water. Do you have the patience to wait till your mud settles and the water is clear? Can you remain unmoving till the right action arises by itself? The Master doesn't seek fulfillment. Not seeking, not expecting, she is present, and can welcome all things.",
    "Empty your mind of all thoughts. Let your heart be at peace. Watch the turmoil of beings, but contemplate their return. Each separate being in the universe returns to the common source. Returning to the source is serenity. If you don't realize the source, you stumble in confusion and sorrow. When you realize where you come from, you naturally become tolerant, disinterested, amused, kindhearted as a grandmother, dignified as a king. Immersed in the wonder of the Tao, you can deal with whatever life brings you, and when death comes, you are ready.",
    "When the Master governs, the people are hardly aware that he exists. Next best is a leader who is loved. Next, one who is feared. The worst is one who is despised. If you don't trust the people, you make them untrustworthy. The Master doesn't talk, he acts. When his work is done, the people say, \"Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!\"",
    "When the great Tao is forgotten, goodness and piety appear. When the body's intelligence declines, cleverness and knowledge step forth. When there is no peace in the family, filial piety begins. When the country falls into chaos, patriotism is born.",
    "Throw away holiness and wisdom, and people will be a hundred times happier. Throw away morality and justice, and people will do the right thing. Throw away industry and profit, and there won't be any thieves. If these three aren't enough, just stay at the center of the circle and let all things take their course.",
    "Stop thinking, and end your problems. What difference between yes and no? What difference between success and failure? Must you value what others value, avoid what others avoid? How ridiculous! Other people are excited, as though they were at a parade. I alone don't care, I alone am expressionless, like an infant before it can smile. Other people have what they need; I alone possess nothing. I alone drift about, like someone without a home. I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty. Other people are bright; I alone am dark. Other people are sharper; I alone am dull. Other people have a purpose; I alone don't know. I drift like a wave on the ocean, I blow as aimless as the wind. I am different from ordinary people. I drink from the Great Mother's breasts.",
    "The Master keeps her mind always at one with the Tao; that is what gives her her radiance. The Tao is ungraspable. How can her mind be at one with it? Because she doesn't cling to ideas. The Tao is dark and unfathomable. How can it make her radiant? Because she lets it. Since before time and space were, the Tao is. It is beyond is and is not. How do I know this is true? I look inside myself and see.",
    "If you want to become whole, let yourself be partial. If you want to become straight, let yourself be crooked. If you want to become full, let yourself be empty. If you want to be reborn, let yourself die. If you want to be given everything, give everything up. The Master, by residing in the Tao, sets an example for all beings. Because he doesn't display himself, people can see his light. Because he has nothing to prove, people can trust his words. Because he doesn't know who he is, people recognize themselves in him. Because he has no goal in mind, everything he does succeeds. When the ancient Masters said, \"If you want to be given everything, give everything up,\" they weren't using empty phrases. Only in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself.",
    "Express yourself completely, then keep quiet. Be like the forces of nature: when it blows, there is only wind; when it rains, there is only rain; when the clouds pass, the sun shines through. If you open yourself to the Tao, you are at one with the Tao and you can embody it completely. If you open yourself to insight, you are at one with insight and you can use it completely. If you open yourself to loss, you are at one with loss and you can accept it completely. Open yourself to the Tao, then trust your natural responses; and everything will fall into place.",
    "He who stands on tiptoe doesn't stand firm. He who rushes ahead doesn't go far. He who tries to shine dims his own light. He who defines himself can't know who he really is. He who has power over others can't empower himself. He who clings to his work will create nothing that endures. If you want to accord with the Tao, just do your job, then let go.",
    "There was something formless and perfect before the universe was born. It is serene. Empty. Solitary. Unchanging. Infinite. Eternally present. It is the mother of the universe. For lack of a better name, I call it the Tao. It flows through all things, inside and outside, and returns to the origin of all things. The Tao is great. The universe is great. Earth is great. Man is great. These are the four great powers. Man follows the earth. Earth follows the universe. The universe follows the Tao. The Tao follows only itself.",
    "The heavy is the root of the light. The unmoved is the source of all movement. Thus the Master travels all day without leaving home. However splendid the views, she stays serenely in herself. Why should the lord of the country flit about like a fool? If you let yourself be blown to and fro, you lose touch with your root. If you let restlessness move you, you lose touch with who you are.",
    "A good traveler has no fixed plans and is not intent upon arriving. A good artist lets his intuition lead him wherever it wants. A good scientist has freed himself of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is. Thus the Master is available to all people and doesn't reject anyone. He is ready to use all situations and doesn't waste anything. This is called embodying the light. What is a good man but a bad man's teacher? What is a bad man but a good man's job? If you don't understand this, you will get lost, however intelligent you are. It is the great secret.",
    "Know the male, yet keep to the female: receive the world in your arms. If you receive the world, the Tao will never leave you and you will be like a little child. Know the white, yet keep to the black: be a pattern for the world. If you are a pattern for the world, the Tao will be strong inside you and there will be nothing you can't do. Know the personal, yet keep to the impersonal: accept the world as it is. If you accept the world, the Tao will be luminous inside you and you will return to your primal self. The world is formed from the void, like utensils from a block of wood. The Master knows the utensils, yet keeps to the the block: thus she can use all things.",
    "Do you want to improve the world? I don't think it can be done. The world is sacred. It can't be improved. If you tamper with it, you'll ruin it. If you treat it like an object, you'll lose it. There is a time for being ahead, a time for being behind; a time for being in motion, a time for being at rest; a time for being vigorous, a time for being exhausted; a time for being safe, a time for being in danger. The Master sees things as they are, without trying to control them. She lets them go their own way, and resides at the center of the circle.",
    "Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men doesn't try to force issues or defeat enemies by force of arms. For every force there is a counterforce. Violence, even well intentioned, always rebounds upon oneself. The Master does his job and then stops. He understands that the universe is forever out of control, and that trying to dominate events goes against the current of the Tao. Because he believes in himself, he doesn't try to convince others. Because he is content with himself, he doesn't need others' approval. Because he accepts himself, the whole world accepts him.",
    "Weapons are the tools of violence; all decent men detest them. Weapons are the tools of fear; a decent man will avoid them except in the direst necessity and, if compelled, will use them only with the utmost restraint. Peace is his highest value. If the peace has been shattered, how can he be content? His enemies are not demons, but human beings like himself. He doesn't wish them personal harm. Nor does he rejoice in victory. How could he rejoice in victory and delight in the slaughter of men? He enters a battle gravely, with sorrow and with great compassion, as if he were attending a funeral.",
    "The Tao can't be perceived. Smaller than an electron, it contains uncountable galaxies. If powerful men and women could remain centered in the Tao, all things would be in harmony. The world would become a paradise. All people would be at peace, and the law would be written in their hearts. When you have names and forms, know that they are provisional. When you have institutions, know where their functions should end. Knowing when to stop, you can avoid any danger. All things end in the Tao as rivers flow into the sea.",
    "Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich. If you stay in the center and embrace death with your whole heart, you will endure forever.",
    "The great Tao flows everywhere. All things are born from it, yet it doesn't create them. It pours itself into its work, yet it makes no claim. It nourishes infinite worlds, yet it doesn't hold on to them. Since it is merged with all things and hidden in their hearts, it can be called humble. Since all things vanish into it and it alone endures, it can be called great. It isn't aware of its greatness; thus it is truly great.",
    "She who is centered in the Tao can go where she wishes, without danger. She perceives the universal harmony, even amid great pain, because she has found peace in her heart. Music or the smell of good cooking may make people stop and enjoy. But words that point to the Tao seem monotonous and without flavor. When you look for it, there is nothing to see. When you listen for it, there is nothing to hear. When you use it, it is inexhaustible.",
    "If you want to shrink something, you must first allow it to expand. If you want to get rid of something, you must first allow it to flourish. If you want to take something, you must first allow it to be given. This is called the subtle perception of the way things are. The soft overcomes the hard. The slow overcomes the fast. Let your workings remain a mystery. Just show people the results.",
    "The Tao never does anything, yet through it all things are done. If powerful men and women could center themselves in it, the whole world would be transformed by itself, in its natural rhythms. People would be content with their simple, everyday lives, in harmony, and free of desire. When there is no desire, all things are at peace.",
    "The Master doesn't try to be powerful; thus he is truly powerful. The ordinary man keeps reaching for power; thus he never has enough. The Master does nothing, yet he leaves nothing undone. The ordinary man is always doing things, yet many more are left to be done. The kind man does something, yet something remains undone. The just man does something, and leaves many things to be done. The moral man does something, and when no one responds he rolls up his sleeves and uses force. When the Tao is lost, there is goodness. When goodness is lost, there is morality. When morality is lost, there is ritual. Ritual is the husk of true faith, the beginning of chaos. Therefore the Master concerns himself with the depths and not the surface, with the fruit and not the flower. He has no will of his own. He dwells in reality, and lets all illusions go.",
    "In harmony with the Tao, the sky is clear and spacious, the earth is solid and full, all creatures flourish together, content with the way they are, endlessly repeating themselves, endlessly renewed. When man interferes with the Tao, the sky becomes filthy, the earth becomes depleted, the equilibrium crumbles, creatures become extinct. The Master views the parts with compassion, because he understands the whole. His constant practice is humility. He doesn't glitter like a jewel but lets himself be shaped by the Tao, as rugged and common as stone.",
    "Return is the movement of the Tao. Yielding is the way of the Tao. All things are born of being. Being is born of non-being.",
    "When a superior man hears of the Tao, he immediately begins to embody it. When an average man hears of the Tao, he half believes it, half doubts it. When a foolish man hears of the Tao, he laughs out loud. If he didn't laugh, it wouldn't be the Tao. Thus it is said: The path into the light seems dark, the path forward seems to go back, the direct path seems long, true power seems weak, true purity seems tarnished, true steadfastness seems changeable, true clarity seems obscure, the greatest are seems unsophisticated, the greatest love seems indifferent, the greatest wisdom seems childish. The Tao is nowhere to be found. Yet it nourishes and completes all things.",
    "The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two. Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to all things. All things have their backs to the female and stand facing the male. When male and female combine, all things achieve harmony. Ordinary men hate solitude. But the Master makes use of it, embracing his aloneness, realizing he is one with the whole universe.",
    "The gentlest thing in the world overcomes the hardest thing in the world. That which has no substance enters where there is no space. This shows the value of non-action. Teaching without words, performing without actions: that is the Master's way.",
    "Fame or integrity: which is more important? Money or happiness: which is more valuable? Success or failure: which is more destructive? If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never truly be fulfilled. If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself. Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.",
    "True perfection seems imperfect, yet it is perfectly itself. True fullness seems empty, yet it is fully present. True straightness seems crooked. True wisdom seems foolish. True art seems artless. The Master allows things to happen. She shapes events as they come. She steps out of the way and lets the Tao speak for itself.",
    "When a country is in harmony with the Tao, the factories make trucks and tractors. When a country goes counter to the Tao, warheads are stockpiled outside the cities. There is no greater illusion than fear, no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself, no greater misfortune than having an enemy. Whoever can see through all fear will always be safe.",
    "Without opening your door, you can open your heart to the world. Without looking out your window, you can see the essence of the Tao. The more you know, the less you understand. The Master arrives without leaving, sees the light without looking, achieves without doing a thing.",
    "In pursuit of knowledge, every day something is added. In the practice of the Tao, every day something is dropped. Less and less do you need to force things, until finally you arrive at non-action. When nothing is done, nothing is left undone. True mastery can be gained by letting things go their own way. It can't be gained by interfering.",
    "The Master has no mind of her own. She works with the mind of the people. She is good to people who are good. She is also good to people who aren't good. This is true goodness. She trusts people who are trustworthy. She also trusts people who aren't trustworthy. This is true trust. The Master's mind is like space. People don't understand her. They look to her and wait. She treats them like her own children.",
    "The Master gives himself up to whatever the moment brings. He knows that he is going to die, and he has nothing left to hold on to: no illusions in his mind, no resistances in his body. He doesn't think about his actions; they flow from the core of his being. He holds nothing back from life; therefore he is ready for death, as a man is ready for sleep after a good day's work.",
    "Every being in the universe is an expression of the Tao. It springs into existence, unconscious, perfect, free, takes on a physical body, lets circumstances complete it. That is why every being spontaneously honors the Tao. The Tao gives birth to all beings, nourishes them, maintains them, cares for them, comforts them, protects them, takes them back to itself, creating without possessing, acting without expecting, guiding without interfering. That is why love of the Tao is in the very nature of things.",
    "In the beginning was the Tao. All things issue from it; all things return to it. To find the origin, trace back the manifestations. When you recognize the children and find the mother, you will be free of sorrow. If you close your mind in judgements and traffic with desires, your heart will be troubled. If you keep your mind from judging and aren't led by the senses, your heart will find peace. Seeing into darkness is clarity. Knowing how to yield is strength. Use your own light and return to the source of light. This is called practicing eternity.",
    "The great Way is easy, yet people prefer the side paths. Be aware when things are out of balance. Stay centered within the Tao. When rich speculators prosper While farmers lose their land; when government officials spend money on weapons instead of cures; when the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible while the poor have nowhere to turn- all this is robbery and chaos. It is not in keeping with the Tao.",
    "Whoever is planted in the Tao will not be rooted up. Whoever embraces the Tao will not slip away. Her name will be held in honor from generation to generation. Let the Tao be present in your life and you will become genuine. Let it be present in your family and your family will flourish. Let it be present in your country and your country will be an example to all countries in the world. Let it be present in the universe and the universe will sing. How do I know this is true? By looking inside myself.",
    "He who is in harmony with the Tao is like a newborn child. Its bones are soft, its muscles are weak, but its grip is powerful. It doesn't know about the union of male and female, yet its penis can stand erect, so intense is its vital power. It can scream its head off all day, yet it never becomes hoarse, so complete is its harmony. The Master's power is like this. He lets all things come and go effortlessly, without desire. He never expects results; thus he is never disappointed. He is never disappointed; thus his spirit never grows old.",
    "Those who know don't talk. Those who talk don't know. Close your mouth, block off your senses, blunt your sharpness, untie your knots, soften your glare, settle your dust. This is the primal identity. Be like the Tao. It can't be approached or withdrawn from, benefited or harmed, honored or brought into disgrace. It gives itself up continually. That is why it endures.",
    "If you want to be a great leader, you must learn to follow the Tao. Stop trying to control. Let go of fixed plans and concepts, and the world will govern itself. The more prohibitions you have, the less virtuous people will be. The more weapons you have, the less secure people will be. The more subsidies you have, the less self-reliant people will be. Therefore the Master says: I let go of the law, and people become honest. I let go of economics, and people become prosperous. I let go of religion, and people become serene. I let go of all desire for the common good, and the good becomes common as grass.",
    "If a country is governed with tolerance, the people are comfortable and honest. If a country is governed with repression, the people are depressed and crafty. When the will to power is in charge, the higher the ideals, the lower the results. Try to make people happy, and you lay the groundwork for misery. Try to make people moral, and you lay the groundwork for vice. Thus the Master is content to serve as an example and not to impose her will. She is pointed, but doesn't pierce. Straightforward, but supple. Radiant, but easy on the eyes.",
    "For governing a country well there is nothing better than moderation. The mark of a moderate man is freedom from his own ideas. Tolerant like the sky, all-pervading like sunlight, firm like a mountain, supple like a tree in the wind, he has no destination in view and makes use of anything life happens to bring his way. Nothing is impossible for him. Because he has let go, he can care for the people's welfare as a mother cares for her child.",
    "Governing a large country is like frying a small fish. You spoil it with too much poking. Center your country in the Tao and evil will have no power. Not that it isn't there, but you'll be able to step out of its way. Give evil nothing to oppose and it will disappear by itself.",
    "When a country obtains great power, it becomes like the sea: all streams run downward into it. The more powerful it grows, the greater the need for humility. Humility means trusting the Tao, thus never needing to be defensive. A great nation is like a great man: When he makes a mistake, he realizes it. Having realized it, he admits it. Having admitted it, he corrects it. He considers those who point out his faults as his most benevolent teachers. He thinks of his enemy as the shadow that he himself casts. If a nation is centered in the Tao, if it nourishes its own people and doesn't meddle in the affairs of others, it will be a light to all nations in the world.",
    "The Tao is the center of the universe, the good man's treasure, the bad man's refuge. Honors can be bought with fine words, respect can be won with good deeds; but the Tao is beyond all value, and no one can achieve it. Thus, when a new leader is chosen, don't offer to help him with your wealth or your expertise. Offer instead to teach him about the Tao. Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao? Because, being one with the Tao, when you seek, you find; and when you make a mistake, you are forgiven. That is why everybody loves it.",
    "Act without doing; work without effort. Think of the small as large and the few as many. Confront the difficult while it is still easy; accomplish the great task by a series of small acts. The Master never reaches for the great; thus she achieves greatness. When she runs into a difficulty, she stops and gives herself to it. She doesn't cling to her own comfort; thus problems are no problem for her.",
    "What is rooted is easy to nourish. What is recent is easy to correct. What is brittle is easy to break. What is small is easy to scatter. Prevent trouble before it arises. Put things in order before they exist. The giant pine tree grows from a tiny sprout. The journey of a thousand miles starts from beneath your feet. Rushing into action, you fail. Trying to grasp things, you lose them. Forcing a project to completion, you ruin what was almost ripe. Therefore the Master takes action by letting things take their course. He remains as calm at the end as at the beginning. He has nothing, thus has nothing to lose. What he desires is non-desire; what he learns is to unlearn. He simply reminds people of who they have always been. He cares about nothing but the Tao. Thus he can care for all things.",
    "The ancient Masters didn't try to educate the people, but kindly taught them to not-know. When they think that they know the answers, people are difficult to guide. When they know that they don't know, people can find their own way. If you want to learn how to govern, avoid being clever or rich. The simplest pattern is the clearest. Content with an ordinary life, you can show all people the way back to their own true nature.",
    "All streams flow to the sea because it is lower than they are. Humility gives it its power. If you want to govern the people, you must place yourself below them. If you want to lead the people, you must learn how to follow them. The Master is above the people, and no one feels oppressed. She goes ahead of the people, and no one feels manipulated. The whole world is grateful to her. Because she competes with no one, no one can compete with her.",
    "Some say that my teaching is nonsense. Others call it lofty but impractical. But to those who have looked inside themselves, this nonsense makes perfect sense. And to those who put it into practice, this loftiness has roots that go deep. I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures. Simple in actions and in thoughts, you return to the source of being. Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are. Compassionate toward yourself, you reconcile all beings in the world.",
    "The best athlete wants his opponent at his best. The best general enters the mind of his enemy. The best businessman serves the communal good. The best leader follows the will of the people. All of them embody the virtue of non-competition. Not that they don't love to compete, but they do it in the spirit of play. In this they are like children and in harmony with the Tao.",
    'The generals have a saying: "Rather than make the first move it is better to wait and see. Rather than advance an inch it is better to retreat a yard." This is called going forward without advancing, pushing back without using weapons. There is no greater misfortune than underestimating your enemy. Underestimating your enemy means thinking that he is evil. Thus you destroy your three treasures and become an enemy yourself. When two great forces oppose each other, the victory will go to the one that knows how to yield.',
    "My teachings are easy to understand and easy to put into practice. Yet your intellect will never grasp them, and if you try to practice them, you'll fail. My teachings are older than the world. How can you grasp their meaning? If you want to know me, look inside your heart.",
    "Not-knowing is true knowledge. Presuming to know is a disease. First realize that you are sick; then you can move toward health. The Master is her own physician. She has healed herself of all knowing. Thus she is truly whole.",
    "When they lose their sense of awe, people turn to religion. When they no longer trust themselves, they begin to depend upon authority. Therefore the Master steps back so that people won't be confused. He teaches without a teaching, so that people will have nothing to learn.",
    "The Tao is always at ease. It overcomes without competing, answers without speaking a word, arrives without being summoned, accomplishes without a plan. Its net covers the whole universe. And though its meshes are wide, it doesn't let a thing slip through.",
    "If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to. If you aren't afraid of dying, there is nothing you can't achieve. Trying to control the future is like trying to take the master carpenter's place. When you handle the master carpenter's tools, chances are that you'll cut your hand.",
    "When taxes are too high, people go hungry. When the government is too intrusive, people lose their spirit. Act for the people's benefit. Trust them; leave them alone.",
    "Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail.",
    "As it acts in the world, the Tao is like the bending of a bow. The top is bent downward; the bottom is bent up. It adjusts excess and deficiency so that there is perfect balance. It takes from what is too much and give to what isn't enough. Those who try to control, who use force to protect their power, go against the direction of the Tao. They take from those who don't have enough and give to those who have far too much. The Master can keep giving because there is no end to her wealth. She acts without expectation, succeeds without taking credit, and doesn't think that she is better than anyone else.",
    "Nothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water. Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible, nothing can surpass it. The soft overcomes the hard; the gentle overcomes the rigid. Everyone knows this is true, but few can put it into practice. Therefore the Master remains serene in the midst of sorrow. Evil cannot enter his heart. Because he has given up helping, he is people's greatest help. True words seem paradoxical.",
    "Failure is an opportunity. If you blame someone else, there is no end to the blame. Therefore the Master fulfills her own obligations and corrects her own mistakes. She does what she needs to do and demands nothing of others.",
    "If a country is governed wisely, its inhabitants will be content. They enjoy the labor of their hands and don't waste time inventing labor-saving machines. Since they dearly love their homes, they aren't interested in travel. There may be a few wagons and boats, but these don't go anywhere. There may be an arsenal of weapons, but nobody ever uses them. People enjoy their food, take pleasure in being with their families, spend weekends working in their gardens, delight in the doings of the neighborhood. And even though the next country is so close that people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking, they are content to die of old age without ever having gone to see it.",
    "True words aren't eloquent; eloquent words aren't true. Wise men don't need to prove their point; men who need to prove their point aren't wise. The Master has no possessions. The more he does for others, the happier he is. The more he gives to others, the wealthier he is. The Tao nourishes by not forcing. By not dominating, the Master leads.",

    "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth. The named is the mother of the ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery.",
    "Under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness. All can know good as good only because there is evil. Therefore having and not having arise together. Difficult and easy complement each other. Long and short contrast each other. High and low rest upon each other. Voice and sound harmonize each other. Front and back follow one another. Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking. The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease, creating, yet not possessing. Working, yet not taking credit. Work is done, then forgotten. Therefore it lasts forever.",
    "Not exalting the gifted prevents quarreling. Not collecting treasures prevents stealing. Not seeing desirable things prevents confusion of the heart. The wise therefore rule by emptying hearts and stuffing bellies, by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones. If men lack knowledge and desire, then clever people will not try to interfere. If nothing is done, then all will be well.",
    "The Tao is an empty vessel; it is used, but never filled. Oh, unfathomable source of ten thousand things! Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knot, soften the glare, merge with dust. Oh, hidden deep but ever present! I do not know from whence it comes. It is the forefather of the gods.",
    "Heaven and Earth are impartial; they see the ten thousand things as straw dogs. The wise are impartial; they see the people as straw dogs. The space between heaven and Earth is like a bellows. The shape changes but not the form; the more it moves, the more it yields. More words count less. Hold fast to the center.",
    "The valley spirit never dies; it is the woman, primal mother. Her gateway is the root of heaven and Earth. It is like a veil barely seen. Use it; it will never fail.",
    "Heaven and Earth last forever. Why do heaven and Earth last forever? They are unborn, so ever living. The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead. He is detached, thus at one with all. Through selfless action, he attains fulfillment.",
    "The highest good is like water. Water gives life to the ten thousand things and does not strive. It flows in places men reject and so is like the Tao. In dwelling, be close to the land. In meditation, go deep in the heart. In dealing with others, be gentle and kind. In speech, be true. In ruling, be just. In daily life, be competent. In action, be aware of the time and the season. No fight: no blame.",
    "Better to stop short than fill to the brim. Oversharpen the blade and the edge will soon blunt. Amass a store of gold and jade and no one can protect it. Claim wealth and titles, and disaster will follow. Retire when the work is done. This is the way of heaven.",
    "Carrying body and soul and embracing the one, can you avoid separation? Attending fully and becoming supple, can you be as a newborn babe? Washing and cleansing the primal vision, can you be without stain? Loving all men and ruling the country, can you be without cleverness? Opening and closing the gates of heaven, can you play the role of woman? Understanding and being open to all things, are you able to do nothing? Giving birth and nourishing, bearing yet not possessing, working yet not taking credit, leading yet not dominating. This is the Primal Virtue.",
    "Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub; it is the center hole that makes it useful. Shape clay into a vessel; it is the space within that makes it useful. Cut doors and windows for a room; it is the holes which make it useful. Therefore benefit comes from what is there, usefulness from what is not there.",
    "The five colors blind the eye. The five tones deafen the ear. The five flavors dull the taste. Racing and hunting madden the mind. Precious things lead one astray. Therefore the sage is guided by what he feels and not by what he sees. He lets go of that and chooses this.",

This is called "accepting disgrace willingly." What do you mean by "Accept misfortune as the human condition"? Misfortune comes from having a body. Without a body, how could there be misfortune? Surrender yourself humbly, then you can be trusted to care for all things. Love the world as your own self, then you can truly care for all things.',
    "Look, it cannot be seen - it is beyond form. Listen, it cannot be heard - it is beyond sound. Grasp, it cannot be held - it is intangible. These three are indefinable; therefore they are joined in one. From above it is not bright, from below it is not dark. An unbroken thread beyond description. It returns to nothingness. The form of the formless, the image of the imageless, it is called indefinable and beyond imagination. Stand before it and there is no beginning. Follow it and there is no end. Stay with the ancient Tao, move with the present. Knowing the ancient beginning is the essence of Tao.",
    "The ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound, responsive. The depth of their knowledge is unfathomable. Because it is unfathomable, all we can do is describe their appearance. Watchful, like men crossing a winter stream. Alert, like men aware of danger. Courteous, like visiting guests. Yielding, like ice about to melt. Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood. Hollow, like caves. Opaque, like muddy pools. Who can wait quietly while the mud settles? Who can remain still until the moment of action? Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfillment. Not seeking fulfillment, they are not swayed by desire for change.",
    "Empty yourself of everything. Let the mind become still. The ten thousand things rise and fall while the self watches their return. They grow and flourish and then return to the source. Returning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature. The way of nature is unchanging. Knowing constancy is insight. Not knowing constancy leads to disaster. Knowing constancy, the mind is open. With an open mind, you will be openhearted. Being openhearted, you will act royally. Being royal, you will attain the divine. Being divine, you will be at one with the Tao. Being at one with the Tao is eternal. And though the body dies, the Tao will never pass away.",

Give up ingenuity, renounce profit, and bandits and thieves will disappear. These three are outward forms alone; they are not sufficient in themselves. It is more important to see the simplicity, to realize one's true nature, to cast off selfishness and temper desire.",

Other people are contented, enjoying the sacrificial feast of the ox. In spring some go to the park and climb the terrace, but I alone am drifting, not knowing where I am. Like a newborn babe before it learns to smile, I am alone, without a place to go. Others have more than they need, but I alone have nothing. I am a fool. Oh, yes! I am confused. Others are clear and bright, but I alone am dim and weak. Others are sharp and clever, but I alone am dull and stupid. Oh, I drift like the waves of the sea, without direction, like the restless wind. Everyone else is busy, but I alone am aimless and depressed. I am different. I am nourished by the great mother.",

From the very beginning until now its name has never been forgotten. Thus I perceive the creation. How do I know the ways of creation? Because of this.",
    'Yield and overcome; bend and be straight; empty and be full; wear out and be new; have little and gain; have much and be confused. Therefore the wise embrace the one and set an example to all. Not putting on a display, they shine forth. Not justifying themselves, they are distinguished. Not boasting, they receive recognition. Not bragging, they never falter. They do not quarrel, so no one quarrels with them. Therefore the ancients say, "Yield and overcome." Is that an empty saying? Be really whole, and all things will come to you.',
    "To talk little is natural. High winds do not last all morning. Heavy rain does not last all day. Why is this? Heaven and Earth! If heaven and Earth cannot make things eternal, how is it possible for man? He who follows the Tao is at one with the Tao. He who is virtuous experiences Virtue. He who loses the way is lost. When you are at one with the Tao, the Tao welcomes you. When you are at one with Virtue, the Virtue is always there. When you are at one with loss, the loss is experienced willingly. He who does not trust enough will not be trusted.",
    'He who stands on tiptoe is not steady. He who strides cannot maintain the pace. He who makes a show is not enlightened. He who is self-righteous is not respected. He who boasts achieves nothing. He who brags will not endure. According to followers of the Tao, "These are extra food and unnecessary luggage." They do not bring happiness, therefore followers of the Tao avoid them.',
    'Something mysteriously formed, born before heaven and Earth. In the silence and the void, standing alone and unchanging, ever present and in motion. Perhaps it is the mother of ten thousand things. I do not know its name. Call it Tao. For lack of a better word, I call it great. Being great, it flows. It flows far away. Having gone far, it returns. Therefore, "Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; the king is also great." These are the four great powers of the universe, and the king is one of them. Man follows Earth. Earth follows heaven. Heaven follows the Tao. Tao follows what is natural.',
    "The heavy is the root of the light. The still is the master of unrest. Therefore the sage, traveling all day, does not lose sight of his baggage. Though there are beautiful things to be seen, he remains unattached and calm. Why should the lord of ten thousand chariots act lightly in public? To be light is to lose one's root. To be restless is to lose one's control.",
    'A good walker leaves no tracks; a good speaker makes no slips; a good reckoner needs no tally. A good door needs no lock, yet no one can open it. Good binding requires no knots, yet no one can loosen it. Therefore the sage takes care of all men and abandons no one. He takes care of all things and abandons nothing. This is called "following the light." What is a good man? A teacher of a bad man. What is a bad man? A good man\'s charge. If the teacher is not respected, and the student not cared for, confusion will arise, however clever one is. This is the crux of mystery.',

Be the valley of the universe! Being the valley of the universe, ever true and resourceful, return to the state of the uncarved block. When the block is carved, it becomes useful. When the sage uses it, he becomes the ruler. Thus, "A great tailor cuts little."',

If you try to hold it, you will lose it. So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind; sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily; sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness; sometimes one is up and sometimes down. Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.",
    "Whenever you advise a ruler in the way of Tao, counsel him not to use force to conquer the universe. For this would only cause resistance. Thorn bushes spring up wherever the army has passed. Lean years follow in the wake of a great war. Just do what needs to be done. Never take advantage of power. Achieve results, but never glory in them. Achieve results, but never boast. Achieve results, but never be proud. Achieve results, because this is the natural way. Achieve results, but not through violence. Force is followed by loss of strength. This is not the way of Tao. That which goes against the Tao comes to an early end.",
    "Good weapons are instruments of fear; all creatures hate them. Therefore followers of Tao never use them. The wise man prefers the left. The man of war prefers the right. Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools. He uses them only when he has no choice. Peace and quiet are dear to his heart, and victory no cause for rejoicing. If you rejoice in victory, then you delight in killing; if you delight in killing, you cannot fulfill yourself. On happy occasions precedence is given to the left, on sad occasions to the right. In the army the general stands on the left, the commander-in-chief on the right. This means that war is conducted like a funeral. When many people are being killed, they should be mourned in heartfelt sorrow. That is why a victory must be observed like a funeral.",
    "The Tao is forever undefined. Small though it is in the unformed state, it cannot be grasped. If kings and lords could harness it, the ten thousand things would come together and gentle rain fall. Men would need no more instruction and all things would take their course. Once the whole is divided, the parts need names. There are already enough names. One must know when to stop. Knowing when to stop averts trouble. Tao in the world is like a river flowing home to the sea.",
    "Knowing others is wisdom; knowing the self is enlightenment. Mastering others requires force; mastering the self needs strength. He who knows he has enough is rich. Perseverance is a sign of willpower. He who stays where he is endures. To die but not to perish is to be eternally present.",
    "The great Tao flows everywhere, both to the left and to the right. The ten thousand things depend upon it; it holds nothing back. It fulfills its purpose silently and makes no claim. It nourishes the ten thousand things, and yet is not their lord. It has no aim; it is very small. The ten thousand things return to it, yet it is not their lord. It is very great. It does not show greatness, and is therefore truly great.",
    "All men will come to him who keeps to the one, for there lie rest and happiness and peace. Passersby may stop for music and good food, but a description of the Tao seems without substance or flavor. It cannot be seen, it cannot be heard, and yet it cannot be exhausted.",
    "That which shrinks must first expand. That which fails must first be strong. That which is cast down must first be raised. Before receiving there must be giving. This is called perception of the nature of things. Soft and weak overcome hard and strong. Fish cannot leave deep waters, and a country's weapons should not be displayed.",
    "Tao abides in non-action, yet nothing is left undone. If kings and lords observed this, the ten thousand things would develop naturally. If they still desired to act, they would return to the simplicity of formless substance. Without form there is no desire. Without desire there is tranquility. And in this way all things would be at peace.",
    "A truly good man is not aware of his goodness, and is therefore good. A foolish man tries to be good, and is therefore not good. A truly good man does nothing, yet leaves nothing undone. A foolish man is always doing, yet much remains to be done. When a truly kind man does something, he leaves nothing undone. When a just man does something, he leaves a great deal to be done. When a disciplinarian does something and no one responds, he rolls up his sleeves in an attempt to enforce order. Therefore when Tao is lost, there is goodness. When goodness is lost, there is kindness. When kindness is lost, there is justice. When justice is lost, there is ritual. Now ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty, the beginning of confusion. Knowledge of the future is only a flowery trapping of Tao. It is the beginning of folly. Therefore the truly great man dwells on what is real and not what is on the surface, on the fruit and not the flower. Therefore accept the one and reject the other.",
    'These things from ancient times arise from one: The sky is whole and clear. The earth is whole and firm. The spirit is whole and strong. The valley is whole and full. The ten thousand things are whole and alive. Kings and lords are whole, and the country is upright. All these are in virtue of wholeness. The clarity of the sky prevents its falling. The firmness of the earth prevents its splitting. The strength of the spirit prevents its being used up. The fullness of the valley prevents its running dry. The growth of the ten thousand things prevents their drying out. The leadership of kings and lords prevents the downfall of the country. Therefore the humble is the root of the noble. The low is the foundation of the high. Princes and lords consider themselves "orphaned," "widowed," and "worthless". Do they not depend on being humble? Too much success is not an advantage. Do not tinkle like jade or clatter like stone chimes.',
    "Returning is the motion of the Tao. Yielding is the way of the Tao. The ten thousand things are born of being. Being is born of not being.",
    "The wise student hears of the Tao and practices it diligently. The average student hears of the Tao and gives it thought now and again. The foolish student hears of the Tao and laughs aloud. If there were no laughter, the Tao would not be what it is. Hence it is said: The bright path seems dim; going forward seems like retreat; the easy way seems hard; the highest Virtue seems empty; great purity seems sullied; a wealth of Virtue seems inadequate; the strength of Virtue seems frail; real Virtue seems unreal; the perfect square has no corners; great talents ripen late; the highest notes are hard to hear; the greatest form has no shape; the Tao is hidden and without name. The Tao alone nourishes and brings everything to fulfillment.",
    'The Tao begot one. One begot two. Two begot three. And three begot the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang. They achieve harmony by combining these forces. Men hate to be "orphaned," "widowed," or "worthless," but this is how kings and lords describe themselves. For one gains by losing and loses by gaining. What others teach, I also teach; that is: "A violent man will die a violent death!" This will be the essence of my teaching.',
    "The softest thing in the universe overcomes the hardest thing in the universe. That without substance can enter where there is no room. Hence I know the value of non-action. Teaching without words and work without doing are understood by very few.",
    "Fame or self: Which matters more? Self or wealth: Which is more precious? Gain or loss: Which is more painful? He who is attached to things will suffer much. He who saves will suffer heavy loss. A contented man is never disappointed. He who knows when to stop does not find himself in trouble. He will stay forever safe.",
    "Great accomplishment seems imperfect, yet it does not outlive its usefulness. Great fullness seems empty, yet cannot be exhausted. Great straightness seems twisted. Great intelligence seems stupid. Great eloquence seems awkward. Movement overcomes cold. Stillness overcomes heat. Stillness and tranquillity set things in order in the universe.",
    "When the Tao is present in the universe, the horses haul manure. When the Tao is absent from the universe, war horses are bred outside the city. There is no greater sin than desire, no greater curse than discontent, no greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself. Therefore he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.",
    "Without going outside, you may know the whole world. Without looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven. The farther you go, the less you know. Thus the sage knows without traveling; he sees without looking; he works without doing.",
    "In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired. In the pursuit of Tao, every day something is dropped. Less and less is done until non-action is achieved. When nothing is done, nothing is left undone. The world is ruled by letting things take their course. It cannot be ruled by interfering.",
    "The sage has no mind of his own. He is aware of the needs of others. I am good to people who are good. I am also good to people who are not good. Because Virtue is goodness. I have faith in people who are faithful. I also have faith in people who are not faithful. Because Virtue is faithfulness. The sage is shy and humble - to the world he seems confusing. Others look to him and listen. He behaves like a little child.",
    "Between birth and death, three in ten are followers of life, three in ten are followers of death, and men just passing from birth to death also number three in ten. Why is this so? Because they live their lives on the gross level. He who knows how to live can walk abroad without fear of rhinoceros or tiger. He will not be wounded in battle. For in him rhinoceroses can find no place to thrust their horn, tigers no place to use their claws, and weapons no place to pierce. Why is this so? Because he has no place for death to enter.",
    "All things arise from Tao. They are nourished by Virtue. They are formed from matter. They are shaped by environment. Thus the ten thousand things all respect Tao and honor Virtue. Respect of Tao and honor of Virtue are not demanded, but they are in the nature of things. Therefore all things arise from Tao. By Virtue they are nourished, developed, cared for, sheltered, comforted, grown, and protected. Creating without claiming, doing without taking credit, guiding without interfering, this is Primal Virtue.",
    "The beginning of the universe is the mother of all things. Knowing the mother, one also knows the sons. Knowing the sons, yet remaining in touch with the mother, brings freedom from the fear of death. Keep your mouth shut, guard the senses, and life is ever full. Open your mouth, always be busy, and life is beyond hope. Seeing the small is insight; yielding to force is strength. Using the outer light, return to insight, and in this way be saved from harm. This is learning constancy.",
    "If I have even just a little sense, I will walk on the main road and my only fear will be of straying from it. Keeping to the main road is easy, but people love to be sidetracked. When the court is arrayed in splendor, the fields are full of weeds, and the granaries are bare. Some wear gorgeous clothes, carry sharp swords, and indulge themselves with food and drink; they have more possessions than they can use. They are robber barons. This is certainly not the way of Tao.",
    "What is firmly established cannot be uprooted. What is firmly grasped cannot slip away. It will be honored from generation to generation. Cultivate Virtue in your self, and Virtue will be real. Cultivate it in the family, and Virtue will abound. Cultivate it in the village, and Virtue will grow. Cultivate it in the nation, and Virtue will be abundant. Cultivate it in the universe, and Virtue will be everywhere. Therefore look at the body as body; look at the family as family; look at the village as village; look at the nation as nation; look at the universe as universe. How do I know the universe is like this? By looking!",
    "He who is filled with Virtue is like a newborn child. Wasps and serpents will not sting him; wild beasts will not pounce upon him; he will not be attacked by birds of prey. His bones are soft, his muscles weak, but his grip is firm. He has not experienced the union of man and woman, but is whole. His manhood is strong. He screams all day without becoming hoarse. This is perfect harmony. Knowing harmony is constancy. Knowing constancy is enlightenment. It is not wise to rush about. Controlling the breath causes strain. If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows. This is not the way of Tao. Whatever is contrary to Tao will not last long.",
    "Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know. Keep your mouth closed. Guard your senses. Temper your sharpness. Simplify your problems. Mask your brightness. Be at one with the dust of the Earth. This is primal union. He who has achieved this state is unconcerned with friends and enemies, with good and harm, with honor and disgrace. This therefore is the highest state of man.",
    "Rule a nation with justice. Wage war with surprise moves. Become master of the universe without striving. How do I know that this is so? Because of this! The more laws and restrictions there are, the poorer people become. The sharper men's weapons, the more trouble in the land. The more ingenious and clever men are, the more strange things happen. The more rules and regulations, the more thieves and robbers. Therefore the sage says: I take no action and people are reformed. I enjoy peace and people become honest. I do nothing and people become rich. I have no desires and people return to the good and simple life.",
    "When the country is ruled with a light hand the people are simple. When the country is ruled with severity, the people are cunning. Happiness is rooted in misery. Misery lurks beneath happiness. Who knows what the future holds? There is no honesty. Honesty becomes dishonest. Goodness becomes witchcraft. Man's bewitchment lasts for a long time. Therefore the sage is sharp but not cutting, pointed but not piercing, straightforward but not unrestrained, brilliant but not blinding.",
    "In caring for others and serving heaven, there is nothing like using restraint. Restraint begins with giving up one's own ideas. This depends on Virtue gathered in the past. If there is a good store of Virtue, then nothing is impossible. If nothing is impossible, then there are no limits. If a man knows no limits, then he is fit to be a ruler. The mother principle of ruling holds good for a long time. This is called having deep roots and a firm foundation, the Tao of long life and eternal vision.",
    "Ruling the country is like cooking a small fish. Approach the universe with Tao, and evil is not powerful, but its power will not be used to harm others. Not only will it do no harm to others, but the sage himself will also be protected. They do not hurt each other, and the Virtue in each one refreshes both.",
    "A great country is like low land. It is the meeting ground of the universe, the mother of the universe. The female overcomes the male with stillness, lying low in stillness. Therefore if a great country gives way to a smaller country, it will conquer the smaller country. And if a small country submits to a great country, it can conquer the great country. Therefore those who would conquer must yield, and those who conquer do so because they yield. A great nation needs more people; a small country needs to serve. Each gets what it wants. It is fitting for a great nation to yield.",
    "Tao is source of the ten thousand things. It is the treasure of the good man, and the refuge of the bad. Sweet words can buy honor; good deeds can gain respect. If a man is bad, do not abandon him. Therefore on the day the emperor is crowned, or the three officers of state installed, do not send a gift of jade and a team of four horses, but remain still and offer the Tao. Why does everyone like the Tao so much at first? Isn't it because you find what you seek and are forgiven when you sin? Therefore this is the greatest treasure of the universe.",
    "Practice non-action. Work without doing. Taste the tasteless. Magnify the small, increase the few. Reward bitterness with care. See simplicity in the complicated. Achieve greatness in little things. In the universe the difficult things are done as if they are easy. In the universe great acts are made up of small deeds. The sage does not attempt anything very big, and thus achieved greatness. Easy promises make for little trust. Taking things lightly results in great difficulty. Because the sage always confronts difficulties, he never experiences them.",
    "Peace is easily maintained; trouble is easily overcome before it starts. The brittle is easily shattered; the small is easily scattered. Deal with it before it happens. Set things in order before there is confusion. A tree as great as a man's embrace springs up from a small shoot; a terrace nine stories high begins with a pile of earth; a journey of a thousand miles starts under one's feet. He who acts defeats his own purpose; he who grasps loses. The sage does not act, and so is not defeated. He does not grasp and therefore does not lose. People usually fail when they are on the verge of success. So give as much care to the end as to the beginning; then there will be no failure. Therefore the sage seeks freedom from desire. He does not collect precious things. He learns not to hold on to ideas. He brings men back to what they have lost. He helps the ten thousand things find their own nature, but refrains from action.",
    "In the beginning those who knew the Tao did not try to enlighten others, but kept it hidden. Why is it so hard to rule? Because people are so clever. Rulers who try to use cleverness cheat the country. Those who rule without cleverness are a blessing to the land. These are the two alternatives. Understanding these is Primal Virtue. Primal Virtue is deep and far. It leads all things back toward the great oneness.",
    "Why is the sea king of a hundred streams? Because it lies below them. Therefore it is the king of a hundred streams. If the sage would guide the people, he must serve with humility. If he would lead them, he must follow behind. In this way when the sage rules, the people will not feel oppressed; when he stands before them, they will not be harmed. The whole world will support him and will not tire of him. Because he does not compete, he does not meet competition.",
    "Everyone under heaven says that my Tao is great and beyond compare. Because it is great, it seems different. If it were not different, it would have vanished long ago. I have three treasures which I hold and keep. The first is mercy; the second is economy; the third is daring not to be ahead of others. From mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity; from humility comes leadership. Nowadays men shun mercy, but try to be brave; they abandon economy, but try to be generous; they do not believe in humility, but always try to be first. This is certain death. Mercy brings victory in battle and strength in defense. It is the means by which heaven saves and guards.",
    "A good soldier is not violent. A good fighter is not angry. A good winner is not vengeful. A good employer is humble. This is known as the Virtue of not striving. This is known as ability to deal with people. This since ancient times has been known as the ultimate unity with heaven.",
    "There is a saying among soldiers: I dare not make the first move but would rather play the guest; I dare not advance an inch but would rather withdraw a foot. This is called marching without appearing to move, rolling up your sleeves without showing your arm, capturing the enemy without attacking, being armed without weapons. There is no greater catastrophe than underestimating the enemy. By underestimating the enemy, I almost lost what I value. Therefore when the battle is joined, the underdog will win.",
    "My words are easy to understand and easy to perform, yet no man under heaven knows them or practices them. My words have ancient beginnings. My actions are disciplined. Because men do not understand, they have no knowledge of me. Those that know me are few; those that abuse me are honored. Therefore the sage wears rough clothing and holds the jewel in his heart.",
    "Knowing ignorance is strength. Ignoring knowledge is sickness. If one is sick of sickness, then one is not sick. The sage is not sick because he is sick of sickness. Therefore he is not sick.",
    "When men lack a sense of awe, there will be disaster. Do not intrude in their homes. Do not harass them at work. If you do not interfere, they will not weary of you. Therefore the sage knows himself but makes no show, has self-respect but is not arrogant. He lets go of that and chooses this.",
    "A brave and passionate man will kill or be killed. A brave and calm man will always preserve life. Of these two which is good and which is harmful? Some things are not favored by heaven. Who knows why? Even the sage is unsure of this. The Tao of heaven does not strive, and yet it overcomes. It does not speak, and yet is answered. It does not ask, yet is supplied with all its needs. It seems to have no aim and yet its purpose is fulfilled. Heaven's net casts wide. Though its meshes are course, nothing slips through.",
    "If men are not afraid to die, it is no avail to threaten them with death. If men live in constant fear of dying, and if breaking the law means that a man will be killed, who will dare to break the law? There is always an official executioner. If you try to take his place, it is like trying to be a master carpenter and cutting wood. If you try to cut wood like a master carpenter, you will only hurt your hand.",
    "Why are the people starving? Because the rulers eat up the money in taxes. Therefore the people are starving. Why are the people rebellious? Because the rulers interfere too much. Therefore they are rebellious. Why do the people think so little of death? Because the rulers demand too much of life. Therefore the people take death lightly. Having little to live on, one knows better than to value life too much.",
    "A man is born gentle and weak. At his death he is hard and stiff. Green plants are tender and filled with sap. At their death they are withered and dry. Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death. The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life. Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle. A tree that is unbending is easily broken. The hard and strong will fall. The soft and weak will overcome.",
    "The Tao of heaven is like the bending of a bow. The high is lowered, and the low is raised. If the string is too long, it is shortened; if there is not enough, it is made longer. The Tao of heaven is to take from those who have too much and give to those who do not have enough. Man's way is different. He takes from those who do not have enough and gives to those who already have too much. What man has more than enough and gives it to the world? Only the man of Tao. Therefore the sage works without recognition. He achieves what has to be done without dwelling on it. He does not try to show his knowledge.",
    "Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water. Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better; it has no equal. The weak can overcome the strong; the supple can overcome the stiff. Under heaven everyone knows this, yet no one puts it into practice. Therefore the sage says: He who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people is fit to rule them. He who takes upon himself the country's disasters deserves to be king of the universe. The truth often sounds paradoxical.",
    "After a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain. What can one do about it? Therefore the sage keeps his half of the bargain but does not exact his due. A man of Virtue performs his part, but a man without Virtue requires others to fulfill their obligations. The Tao of heaven is impartial. It stays with good men all the time.",
    "A small country has fewer people. Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster than man, they are not needed. The people take death seriously and do not travel far. Though they have boats and carriages, no one uses them. Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them. Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing. Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple, their homes secure; they are happy in their ways. Though they live within sight of their neighbors, and crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way, yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die.",
    "Truthful words are not beautiful. Beautiful words are not truthful. Good men do not argue. Those who argue are not good. Those who know are not learned. The learned do not know. The sage never tries to store things up. The more he does for others, the more he has. The more he gives to others, the greater his abundance. The Tao of heaven is pointed but does no harm. The Tao of the sage is work without effort.",

    "Tao called Tao is not Tao. Names can name no lasting name. Nameless: the origin of heaven and earth. Naming: the mother of ten thousand things. Empty of desire, perceive mystery. Filled with desire, perceive manifestations. These have the same source, but different names. Call them both deep - deep and again deep: the gateway to all mystery.",
    "Recognize beauty and ugliness is born. Recognize good and evil is born. Is and isn't produce each other. Hard depends on easy, long is tested by short, high is determined by low, sound is harmonized by voice, after is followed by before. Therefore the sage is devoted to non action, moves without teaching, creates ten thousand things without instruction, lives but does not own, acts but does not presume, accomplishes without taking credit. When no credit is taken, accomplishment endures.",
    "Don't glorify heroes and people will not contend. Don't treasure rare objects and no one will steal. Don't display what people desire and their hearts will not be disturbed. Therefore, the Sage rules by emptying hearts and filling bellies, by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones; leads people away from knowing and wanting; deters those who know too much from going too far: practices non-action and the natural order is not disrupted.",
    "Tao is empty - its use never exhausted. Bottomless - the origin of all things. It blunts sharp edges, unties knots, softens glare, becomes one with the dusty world. Deeply subsistent - I don't know whose child it is. It is older than the Ancestor.",
    "Heaven and Earth are not kind: The ten thousand things are straw dogs to them. The Sage is not kind: People are straw dogs to him. Yet Heaven and Earth and all the space between are like a bellows: Empty but inexhaustible, always producing more. Longwinded speech is exhausting. Better to stay centered.",
    "The Valley Spirit never dies. It is called the Mysterious Female. The entrance to the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Endless flow of inexhaustible energy.",
    "Heaven is long, Earth enduring. Long and enduring because they do not exist for themselves. Therefore the Sage steps back, but is always in front, stays outside, but is always within. No self-interest? Self is fulfilled?",
    "Best to be like water, which benefits the ten thousand things and does not contend. It pools where humans disdain to dwell, close to the Tao. Live in a good place. Keep your mind deep. Treat others well. Stand by your word. Make fair rules. Do the right thing. Work when it's time. Only do not contend, and you will not go wrong.",
    "Hold and fill it - not as good as stopping in time. Measure and pound it - it will not long survive. When gold and jade fill the hall, they cannot be guarded. Riches and pride bequeath error. Withdrawing when work is done: Heaven's Tao.",
    "Can you balance your life force and embrace the One without separation? Can you control your breath gently like a baby? Can you clarify your dark vision without blemish? Can you love people and govern the country without knowledge? Can you open and close the gate of heaven without clinging to earth? Can you brighten the four directions without action? Give birth and cultivate. Give birth and do not possess. Act without dependence. Excel but do not rule. This is called the dark Te.",
    "Thirty spokes join one hub. The wheel's use comes from emptiness. Clay is fired to make a pot. The pot's use comes from emptiness. Windows and doors are cut to make a room. The room's use comes from emptiness. Therefore, having leads to profit, not having leads to use.",
    "Five colors darken the eyes. Five tones darken the ears. Five tastes jade the palate. Hunting and racing madden the heart. Exotic goods ensnarl human lives. Therefore the Sage takes care of the belly, not the eye, chooses one, rejects the other.",
    "Favour and disgrace are like fear. Honour and distress are like the self. What does this mean? Favour debases us. Afraid when we get it, afraid when we lose it. The self embodies distress. No self, no distress. Respect the world as your self: The world can be your lodging. Love the world as your self: The world can be your trust.",
    "Seeing but not seeing, we call it dim. Listening but not hearing, we call it faint. Groping but not touching, we call it subtle. These three cannot be fully grasped. Therefore they become one. Rising, it is not bright; setting, it is not dark. It moves all things back to where there is nothing. Meeting it there is no front, following it there is no back. Live in the ancient Tao, master the existing present, understand the source of all things. This is called the record of Tao.",
    "The ancients who followed Tao: Dark, wondrous, profound, penetrating. Deep beyond knowing. Because they cannot be known, they can only be described. Cautious, like crossing a winter stream. Hesitant, like respecting one's neighbours. Polite, like a guest. Yielding, like ice about to melt. Blank, like uncarved wood. Open, like a valley. Mixing freely, like muddy water. Calm the muddy water, it becomes clear. Move the inert, it comes to life. Those who sustain Tao do not wish to be full. Because they do not wish to be full they can fade away without further effort.",
    "Attain complete emptiness, hold fast to stillness. The ten thousand things stir about; I only watch for their going back. Things grow and grow, but each goes back to its root. Going back to the root is stillness. This means returning to what is. Returning to what is means going back to the ordinary. Understanding the ordinary: Enlightenment. Not understanding the ordinary: Blindness creates evil. Understanding the ordinary: Mind opens. Mind opening leads to compassion, compassion to nobility, nobility to heavenliness, heavenliness to Tao. Tao endures. Your body dies. There is no danger.",
    "Great rising and falling - people only know it exists. Next they see and praise. Soon they fear. Finally they despise. Without fundamental trust there is no trust at all. Be careful in valuing words. When the work is done, everyone says we just acted naturally.",

    "Banish learning, discard knowledge: People will gain a hundredfold. Banish benevolence, discard righteousness: People will return to duty and compassion. Banish skill, discard profit: There will be no more thieves. These three statements are not enough. One more step is necessary. Look at plain silk; hold uncarved wood. The self dwindles; desires fade.",
    "Banish learning, no more grief. Between yes and no how much difference? Between good and evil how much difference? What others fear I must fear - How pointless! People are wreathed in smiles as if at a carnival banquet. I alone am passive, giving no sign, like an infant who has not yet smiled. Forlorn as if I had no home. Others have enough and more, I alone am left out. I have the mind of a fool, confused, confused. Others are bright and intelligent, I alone am dull, dull, drifting on the ocean, blown about endlessly. Others have plans, I alone am wayward and stubborn, I alone am different from others, like a baby in the womb.",
    "Great Te appears flowing from Tao. Tao in action - only vague and intangible. Intangible and vague, but within it are images. Vague and intangible; within are entities. Shadowy and obscure; within there is life, life so real, that within it there is trust. From the beginning its name is not lost but reappears through multiple origins. How do I know these origins? Like this.",
    "Crippled become whole, crooked becomes straight, hollow becomes full, worn becomes new, little becomes more, much becomes delusion. Therefore the Sages cling to the One and take care of this world; do not display themselves and therefore shine. Do not assert themselves and therefore stand out. Do not praise themselves and therefore succeed. Do not contend and therefore no one under heaven can contend with them. The old saying crippled becomes whole is not empty words. It becomes whole and returns.",
    "Spare words; nature's way. Violent winds do not blow all morning. Sudden rain cannot pour all day. What causes these things? Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth do not blow and pour for long, how much less should humans? Therefore in following Tao: Those on the way become the way, those who gain become the gain, those who lose become the loss. All within the Tao: The wayfarer, welcome upon the way, those who gain, welcome within gain, those who lose, welcome within loss. Without trust in this, there is no trust at all.",
    "Upon tiptoe: no way to stand. Clambering: no way to walk. Self-display: no way to shine. Self-assertion: no way to succeed. Self-praise: no way to flourish. Complacency: no way to endure. According to Tao, excessive food, extraneous activity inspire disgust. Therefore the follower of Tao moves on.",
    "Something unformed and complete before Heaven and Earth were born, solitary and silent, stands alone and unchanging. Pervading all things without limit. It is like the mother of all things under heaven, but I don't know its name - better call it Tao. Better call it great. Great means passing on. Passing on means going far. Going far means returning. Therefore Tao is great, and heaven, and earth, and humans. Four great things in the world. Aren't humans one of them? Humans follow earth. Earth follows heaven. Heaven follows Tao. Tao follows its own nature.",
    "Gravity is the root of lightness, stillness the master of passion. The Sage travels all day but does not leave the baggage-cart; when surrounded by magnificent scenery remains calm and still. When a lord of ten thousand chariots behaves lightly in this world, lightness loses its root, passion loses its master.",
    "Good travelers leave no tracks. Good words leave no trace. Good counting needs no markers. Good doors have no bolts yet cannot be forced. Good knots have no rope but cannot be untied. In this way the Sage always helps people and rejects none, always helps all beings, and rejects none. This is called practicing brightness. Therefore the good person is the bad person's teacher, and the bad person is the good person's resource. Not to value the teacher, not to love the resource, causes great confusion even for the intelligent. This is called the vital secret.",
    "Know the male, maintain the female, become the channel of the world, and Te will endure. Return to infancy. Know the white, sustain the black, become the pattern of the world, and Te will not falter. Return to the uncarved block. Know honour, sustain disgrace, become the valley of the world, and Te will prevail. Return to simplicity. Simplicity divided becomes utensils that are used by the Sage as high official. But great governing does not carve up.",
    "Trying to control the world? I see you won't succeed. The world is a spiritual vessel and cannot be controlled. Those who control, fail. Those who grasp, lose. Some go forth, some are led, some weep, some blow flutes, some become strong, some superfluous, some oppress, some are destroyed. Therefore the Sage casts off extremes, casts off excess, casts off extravagance.",
    "Use Tao to help rule people. This world has no need for weapons, which soon turn on themselves. Where armies camp, nettles grow. After each war, years of famine. The most fruitful outcome does not depend on force, but succeeds without arrogance without hostility without pride without resistance without violence. If these things prosper and grow old, this is called not-Tao. Not-Tao soon ends.",
    "Fine weapons are ill-omened tools. They are hated. Therefore the old Tao ignores them. At home, honour the left. In war, honor the right. Good omens honour the left. Bad omens honour the right. The lieutenant on the left, the general on the right as in funeral ceremonies. Weapons are ill-omened, not proper instruments. When their use can't be avoided, calm restraint is best. Don't think they are beautiful. Those who think they are beautiful rejoice in killing people. Those who rejoice in killing people cannot achieve their purpose in this world. When many people are killed we feel sorrow and grief. A great victory is a funeral ceremony.",
    "Tao endures without a name. Though simple and slight, no one under heaven can master it. If kings and lords could posses it, all beings would become their guests. Heaven and earth together would drip sweet dew equally on all people without regulation. Begin to make order and names arise. Names lead to more names - and to knowing when to stop. Tao's presence in this world is like valley streams flowing into rivers and seas.",
    "Knowing others is intelligent. Knowing yourself is enlightened. Conquering others takes force. Conquering yourself is true strength. Knowing what is enough is wealth. Forging ahead shows inner resolve. Hold your ground and you will last long. Die without perishing and your life will endure.",
    "Great Tao overflows. To the left to the right. All beings owe their life to it and do not depart from it. It acts without a name. It clothes and nourishes all beings but does not become their master. Enduring without desires, it may be called slight. All beings return to it, but it does not become their master. It may be called immense. By not making itself great, it can do great things.",
    "Hold the great elephant - the great image - and the world moves. Moves without danger in safety and peace. Music and sweets make passing guests pause. But the Tao emerges flavourless and bland. Look - you won't see it. Listen - you won't hear it. Use it - you will never use it up.",
    "To collect, first scatter. To weaken, first strengthen. To abolish, first establish. To conclude, first initiate. This is called subtle illumination. Soft and weak overcome stiff and strong. Fish cannot escape the deep pool. A country's sharpest weapons cannot be displayed.",
    "Tao endures without a name, yet nothing is left undone. If kings and lords could possess it, all beings would transform themselves. Transformed, they desire to create; I quiet them through nameless simplicity. Then there is no desire. No desire is serenity, and the world settles of itself.",
    "High Te? No Te! That's what Te is. Low Te doesn't lack Te; That's what Te is not. Those highest in Te take no action and don't need to act. Those lowest in Te take action and do need to act. Those highest in benevolence take action but don't need to act. Those highest in righteousness take action and do need to act. Those highest in propriety take action and if people don't reciprocate roll up their sleeves and throw them out. Therefore lose Tao and Te follows. Lose Te and benevolence follows. Lose benevolence and righteousness follows. Lose righteousness and propriety follows. Propriety dilutes loyalty and sincerity: Confusion begins. Foreknowledge glorifies the Tao: Stupidity sets in. And so the ideal person dwells in substance, not dilution, in reality, not glory, accepts one, rejects the other.",
    "Of old, these attained the One: Heaven attaining the One became clear. Earth attaining the One became stable. Spirits attaining the One became sacred. Valleys attaining the One became bountiful. Myriad beings attaining the One became fertile. Lords and kings attaining the One purified the world. If Heaven were not clear, it might split. If Earth were not stable, it might erupt. If spirits were not sacred, they might fade. If valleys were not bountiful, they might wither. If myriad beings were not fertile, they might perish. If rulers and lords were not noble, they might stumble. Therefore, noble has humble as its root, high has low as its foundation. Rulers and lords call themselves poor and lonely orphans. Isn't this using humility as a root? They use many carriages but have no carriage. They do not desire to glisten like jade but drop like a stone.",
    "Reversal is Tao's movement. Yielding is Tao's practice. All things originate from being. Being originates from non-being.",
    "The great scholar hearing the Tao tries to practice it. The middling scholar hearing the Tao, sometimes has it, sometimes not. The lesser scholar hearing the Tao has a good laugh. Without that laughter it wouldn't be Tao. Therefore these sayings: The bright road seems dark, the road forward seems to retreat, the level road seems rough. Great Te seems hollow. Great purity seems sullied. Pervasive Te seems deficient. Established Te seems furtive. Simple truths seem to change. The great square has no corners. The great vessel is finished late. The great sound is scarcely voiced. The great image has no form. Tao hides, no name. Yet Tao alone gets things done.",
    'Tao engenders one, one engenders two, two engenders three, three engenders the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things carry shade and embrace sunlight. Shade and sunlight, yin and yang, breath blending into harmony. Humans hate to be alone, poor, and hungry. Yet kings and princes use these words as titles. We gain by losing, lose by gaining. What others teach, I also teach: "A violent man does not die a natural death." This is the basis of my teaching.',
    "The softest thing in the world rides roughshod over the strongest. No-thing enters no-space. This teaches me the benefits of no-action. Teaching without words benefit without action - few in this world can attain this.",
    "Name or body: which is closer? Body or possessions: which means more? Gain or loss: which one hurts? Extreme love exacts a great price. Many possessions entail a heavy loss. Know what is enough - abuse nothing. Know when to stop - harm nothing. This is how to last for a long time.",
    "Great accomplishment seems unfinished but its use is continuous. Great fullness seems empty but in use is inexhaustible. Great straightness seems bent, great skill seems clumsy, great eloquence seems mute. Exertion overcomes cold. Calm overcomes heat. Pure calm is the norm under heaven.",
    "With Tao under heaven stray horses fertilize the fields. Without Tao under heaven warhorses are bred at the frontier. There is no greater calamity than not knowing what is enough. There is no greater fault than desire for success. Therefore, knowing that enough is enough is always enough.",
    "Without going out the door, know the world. Without peeping through the window, see heaven's Tao. The further you travel, the less you know. This is why the Sage knows without budging, identifies without looking, does without trying.",
    "Pursue knowledge, gain daily. Pursue Tao, lose daily. Lose and again lose, arrive at non-doing. Non-doing - and nothing not done. Take the entire world as nothing. Make the least effort, and the world escapes you.",
    "The Sage has no set heart. Ordinary people's hearts become the Sage's heart. People who are good I treat well. People who are not good I also treat well: Te as goodness. Trustworthy people I trust. Untrustworthy people I also trust. Te as trust. Sages create harmony under heaven blending their hearts with the world. Ordinary people fix their eyes and ears upon them, but Sages become the world's children.",
    "Emerge into life, enter death. Life is only the thirteen body parts. Death is only the thirteen body parts. Human life, moving towards death, is the same thirteen. Why is this? Because life gives life to substance. You have heard of people good at holding on to life. Walking overland they don't avoid rhinos and tigers. In battle they don't arm themselves. The rhino's horn finds nothing to gore, the tiger's claws find nothing to flay, weapons find nothing to pierce. Why is this? They have no mortal spot.",
    "Tao bears them, Te nurses them, events form them, energy completes them. Therefore the ten thousand beings honour Tao and respect Te. Tao is honoured Te is respected because they do not give orders but endure in their own nature. Therefore, Tao bears them and Te nurses them, rears them, raises them, shelters them, nurtures them, supports them, protects them. Bears them without owning them, helps them without coddling them, rears them without ruling them. This is called original Te.",
    "The world has a source: the world's mother. Once you have the mother, you know the children. Once you know the children, return to the mother. Your body dies. There is no danger. Block the passage, bolt the gate: No strain until your life ends. Open the passage, take charge of things: No relief until your life ends. Seeing the small is called brightness. Maintaining gentleness is called strength. Use this brightness to return to brightness. Don't cling to your body's woes. Then you can learn endurance.",
    "Having some knowledge when walking on the great Tao only brings fear. The great Tao is very smooth, but people like rough trails. The government is divided, fields are overgrown, granaries are empty, but the nobles clothes are gorgeous, their belts show off swords, and they are glutted with food and drink. Personal wealth is excessive. This is called thieves' endowment, but it is not Tao.",
    "Well planted, not uprooted. Well embraced, never lost. Descendants will continue the ancestral rituals. Maintain oneself: Te becomes real. Maintain the family: Te becomes abundant. Maintain the community: Te becomes extensive. Maintain the country: Te becomes public. Maintain the world: Te becomes omnipresent. Therefore, through self contemplate self, through family contemplate family, through community contemplate community, through country contemplate country, through world contemplate world. How do I know the world? Like this!",
    "Be filled with Te, like a baby: Wasps, scorpions and vipers do not sting it. Fierce tigers do not stalk it. Birds of prey do not attack it. Bones weak, muscles soft, but its grasp is tight. It does not yet know union of male and female, but its sex is formed, its vital essence complete. It can scream all day and not get hoarse, its harmony is complete. Knowing harmony is called endurance. Knowing endurance is called illumination. Increasing life is called fortune. Mind controlling energy is called power. When beings prosper and grow old, call them not-Tao. Not-Tao soon ends.",
    "Those who know don't talk. Those who talk don't know. Block the passage, bolt the gate, blunt the sharp, untie the knot, blend with the light, become one with the dust - this is called original unity. It can't be embraced, it can't be escaped, it can't be helped, it can't be harmed, it can't be exalted, it can't be despised. Therefore it is revered under Heaven.",
    "Use the unexpected to govern the country, use surprise to wage war, use non-action to win the world. How do I know? Like this! The more prohibitions and rules, the poorer people become. The sharper people's weapons, the more they riot. The more skilled their techniques, the more grotesque their works. The more elaborate the laws, the more they commit crimes. Therefore the Sage says, I do nothing and people transform themselves. I enjoy serenity and people govern themselves. I cultivate emptiness and people become prosperous. I have no desires and people simplify themselves.",
    "If government is muted and muffled people are cool and refreshed. If government investigates and intrudes, people are worn down and hopeless. Bad fortune rests upon good fortune. Good luck hides within bad luck. Who knows how it will end? If there is no principle, principle reverts to disorder, good reverts to calamity, people's confusion hardens and lingers on. Therefore the Sage squares without cutting, corners without dividing, straightens without extending, shines without dazzling.",
    "Governing people and serving heaven is like living off the land. Living sparingly and responding quickly means accumulating Te. There is nothing that cannot be overcome. There is no limit. You can become the country and the country's mother, and nourish and extend it. This is called deep roots, firm base. This is the Tao of living long and seeing far.",
    "Govern big countries like you cook a little fish. When Tao harmonizes the world, demons lose their power. Not that demons lose their power, but their power does not harm people. Not that their power does not harm people, but the Sage does not harm people. If neither does harm, then Te flows and returns.",
    "A great nation flows down to be the world's pool, the female under heaven. In stillness the female constantly overcomes the male, in stillness takes the low place. Therefore a great nation lowers itself and wins over a small one. A small nation keeps itself low and wins over a great one. Sometimes becoming low wins, sometimes staying low wins. A great nation desires nothing more than to unite and protect people. A small nation desires nothing more than to enter the service of people. When both get what they wish the great one should be low.",
    "Tao is the mysterious center of all things, a treasure for those who are good, a refuge for those who are not. Beautiful words can be traded, noble deeds can enhance reputations, but if people lack them, why should they be rejected? When the son of Heaven is enthroned and the Three Ministers installed, presenting jade discs and four-horse chariots cannot compare to sitting still and offering the Tao. The ancients honoured this Tao. Didn't they say: Through it seekers find, through it the guilty escape? This is why Tao is honoured under Heaven.",
    "Act without acting. Serve without serving. Taste without tasting. Big, little, many, few. Repay hatred with Te. Map difficult with easy. Approach great through narrow. The most difficult things in the world must be accomplished through the easiest. The greatest things in the world must be accomplished through the smallest. Therefore the Sage never attempts great things and so accomplishes them. Quick promises mean little trust. Everything easy means great difficulty. Thus for the Sage everything is difficult, and so in the end nothing is difficult.",
    "At rest is easy to hold. Not yet impossible is easy to plan. Brittle is easy to break. Fine is easy to scatter. Create before it exists. Lead before it goes astray. A tree too big to embrace is born from a slender shoot. A nine-story rises from a pile of earth. A thousand-mile journey begins with a single step. Act and you ruin it. Grasp and you lose it. Therefore the Sage does not act and so does not ruin, does not grasp and so does not lose. People commonly ruin their work when they are near success. Proceed at the end as at the beginning and your work won't be ruined. Therefore the Sage desires no desires, prizes no prizes, studies no studies, and returns to what others pass by. The Sage helps all beings find their nature, but does not presume to act.",
    "Taoist rulers of old did not enlighten people but left them dull. People are difficult to govern because they are very clever. Therefore, ruling through cleverness leads to rebellion. Not leading through cleverness brings good fortune. Know these two things and understanding the enduring pattern. Understand the enduring pattern: This is called original Te. Original Te goes deep and far. All things reverse, return, and reach the great headwaters.",
    "Rivers and seas can rule the hundred valleys. Because they are good at lying low they are lords of the valleys. Therefore those who would be above must speak as if they are below. Those who would lead must speak as if they are behind. In this way the Sage dwells above and the people are not burdened. Dwells in front and they are not hindered. Therefore the whole world is delighted and unwearied. Since the Sage does not contend no one can contend with the Sage.",
    "Everyone under heaven calls my Tao great, and unlike anything else. It is great only because it is unlike anything else. If it were like anything else it would stretch and become thin. I have three treasures to maintain and conserve: the first is compassion. The second is frugality. The third is not presuming to be first under heaven. Compassion leads to courage. Frugality allows generosity. Not presuming to be first creates a lasting instrument. Nowadays, people reject compassion but want to be brave, reject frugality but want to be generous, reject humility and want to come first. This is death. Compassion: Attack with it and win. Defend with it and stand firm. Heaven aids and protects through compassion.",
    "The accomplished person is not aggressive. The good soldier is not hot tempered. The best conqueror does not engage the enemy. The most effective leader takes the lowest place. This is called the Te of not contending. This is called the power of the leader. This is called matching Heaven's ancient ideal.",
    "There is a saying in the army: I do not presume to be the master, but become the guest. I do not dare advance an inch, but retreat a foot. This is called moving without moving, rolling up sleeves without showing your arms, repelling without opposing, wielding without a weapon. There is no disaster greater than contempt for the enemy. Contempt for the enemy - what a treasure is lost! Therefore, when the fighting gets hot, those who grieve will conquer.",
    "My words are very easy to understand, very easy to practice. No one under heaven can understand them, no one can practice them. Words have ancestors, deeds have masters. If people don't understand this, they don't understand me. Few understand me, and that is my value. Therefore the Sage wears rough clothing and carries jade inside.",
    "Know not-knowing: supreme. Not know knowing: faulty. Only faulting faults is faultless. The Sage is faultless by faulting faults, and so is without fault.",
    "When people are not in awe of power, power becomes great. Do not intrude into their homes, do not make their lives weary. If you do not weary them, they will not become weary of you. Therefore the Sage has self-knowledge without self-display, self-love without personal pride, rejects one, accepts the other.",
    "Courage to dare kills, courage not to dare saves. One brings profit, one brings harm. Of these two, one is good, and one is harmful. Some are not favored by heaven. Who knows why? Even the wise consider it a difficult question. Heaven hates what it hates - who knows why! Even the Sage finds it difficult. Heaven's Tao does not contend but prevails, does not speak but responds, is not summoned but arrives, is utterly still but plans all actions. Heaven's net is wide, wide, loose - but nothing slips through.",
    "If people do not fear death, how dare you threaten them with death? But if people with a normal fear of death are about to do something vicious, and I could seize and execute them, who would dare? There is always an official executioner. Trying to take the executioner's place, is like trying to replace a master woodworker - few would not slice their own hands.",
    "People are hungry. When rulers tax grain people are hungry. People are rebellious. When rulers are active people are rebellious. People ignore death. When searching only for life's bounty people ignore death. Only those who do not strive after life truly respect life.",
    "Humans are born soft and weak. They die stiff and strong. The ten thousand plants and trees are born soft and tender, and die withered and sere. The stiff and strong are Death's companions. The soft and weak are Life's companions. Therefore the strongest armies do not conquer, the greatest trees are cut down. The strong and great sink down. The soft and weak rise up.",
    "Heaven's Tao is a stretched bow, pulling down on the top, pulling up on the bottom. If it's too much, cut. If it's not enough, add on to it: Heaven's Tao. The human route is not like this. Depriving the poor, offering to the rich. Who has a surplus and still offers it to the world? Only those with Tao. Therefore the Sage acts and expects nothing, accomplishes and does not linger, has no desire to seem worthy.",
    "Nothing in the world is soft and weak as water. But when attacking the hard and strong nothing can conquer so easily. Weak overcomes strong, soft overcomes hard. Everyone knows this, no one attains it. Therefore the Sage says: Accept a country's filth and become master of its sacred soil. Accept a country's ill fortune and become king under heaven. True words resemble their opposites.",
    "Appears great hatred and hatred will remain. How can this be good? Therefore the Sage holds the tally but does not judge people. Those who have Te control the tally. Those who lack Te collect their due. Heaven has no favourites but endures in good people.",
    "Small country, few people - hundreds of devices, but none are used. People ponder on death and don't travel far. They have carriages and boats, but no one goes on board. Weapons and armour, but no one brandishes them. They use knotted cords for counting. Sweet is their food, beautiful their clothes, peaceful their homes, delightful their customs. Neighboring countries are so close you can hear their chickens and dogs, but people grow old and die without needing to come and go.",
    "Sincere words and not pretty. Pretty words are not sincere. Good people do not quarrel. Quarrelsome people are not good. The wise are not learned. The learned are not wise. The Sage is not acquisitive - has enough by doing for others, has even more by giving to others. Heaven's Tao benefits and does not harm. The Sage's Tao acts and does not contend.",

    "The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth. The named is the mother of myriad things. Thus, constantly free of desire one observes its wonders. Constantly filled with desire one observes its manifestations. These two emerge together but differ in name. The unity is said to be the mystery. Mystery of mysteries, the door to all wonders.",
    "When the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When it knows good as good, evil arises. Thus being and non-being produce each other. Difficult and easy bring about each other. Long and short reveal each other. High and low support each other. Music and voice harmonize each other. Front and back follow each other. Therefore the sages: Manage the work of detached actions. Conduct the teaching of no words. They work with myriad things but do not control. They create but do not possess. They act but do not presume. They succeed but do not dwell on success. It is because they do not dwell on success that it never goes away.",
    "Do not glorify the achievers so the people will not squabble. Do not treasure goods that are hard to obtain so the people will not become thieves. Do not show the desired things so their hearts will not be confused. Thus the governance of the sage: empties their hearts, fills their bellies, weakens their ambitions, and strengthens their bones. Let the people have no cunning and no greed so those who scheme will not dare to meddle. Act without contrivance and nothing will be beyond control.",
    "The Tao is empty. Utilize it, it is not filled up. So deep! It seems to be the source of all things. It blunts the sharpness, unravels the knots, dims the glare, mixes the dusts. So indistinct! It seems to exist. I do not know whose offspring it is. Its image is the predecessor of God.",
    "Heaven and Earth are without bias and regard myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is without bias and regards people as straw dogs. The space between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows? Empty, and yet never exhausted. It moves, and produces more. Too many words hasten failure. Cannot compare to keeping quiet.",
    "The valley spirit, undying, is called the mystical female. The gateway of the mystical female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. It flows continuously, barely perceptible. Utilize it, it is never exhausted.",
    "Heaven and earth are everlasting. The reason heaven and earth can last forever is that they do not exist for themselves. Thus they can last forever. Therefore the sage: Places himself last but ends up in front. Is outside of himself and yet survives. Isn't it all due to his selflessness? That's how he can achieve his own goals.",
    "The highest goodness resembles water. Water greatly benefits myriad things without contention. It stays in places that people dislike, therefore it is similar to the Tao. Dwelling at the right place. Heart with great depth. Giving with great kindness. Words with great integrity. Governing with great administration. Handling with great capability. Moving with great timing. Because it does not contend, it is therefore beyond reproach.",
    "Holding a cup and overfilling it cannot be as good as stopping short. Pounding a blade and sharpening it cannot be kept for long. Gold and jade fill up the room, no one is able to protect them. Wealth and position bring arrogance and leave upon oneself disasters. When achievement is completed, fame attained, withdraw oneself. This is the Tao of Heaven.",
    "In holding the soul and embracing oneness, can one be without straying? In concentrating the energy and reaching relaxation, can one be like an infant? In cleaning away the worldly view, can one be without imperfections? In loving the people and ruling the nation, can one be without manipulation? In the heavenly gate's opening and closing, can one hold to the feminine principle? In understanding clearly all directions, can one be without intellectuality? Bearing it, rearing it. Bearing without possession. Achieving without arrogance. Raising without domination. This is called the mystic virtue.",

That which is empty is used to create functionality.",
    "The five colors make one blind in the eyes. The five sounds make one deaf in the ears. The five flavors make one tasteless in the mouth. Racing and hunting make one wild in the heart. Goods that are difficult to acquire make one cause damage. Therefore the sage cares for the stomach and not the eyes. That's why he discards the other and takes this.",

Losing it makes one fearful. This is "favor and disgrace make one fearful" What does "the greatest misfortune is the self" mean? The reason I have great misfortune is that I have the self. If I have no self, what misfortune do I have? So one who values the self as the world can be given the world. One who loves the self as the world can be entrusted with the world.',

These three cannot be completely unraveled so they are combined into one. Above it, not bright. Below it, not dark. Continuing endlessly, cannot be named. It returns back into nothingness. Thus it is called the form of the formless. The image of the imageless. This is called enigmatic. Confront it, its front cannot be seen. Follow it, its back cannot be seen. Wield the Tao of the ancients to manage the existence of today. One can know the ancient beginning. It is called the Tao axiom.",
    "The Tao masters of antiquity, subtle wonders through mystery. Depths that cannot be discerned because one cannot discern them. Therefore one is forced to describe the appearance. Hesitant, like crossing a wintry river. Cautious, like fearing four neighbors. Solemn, like a guest. Loose, like ice about to melt. Genuine, like plain wood. Open, like a valley. Opaque, like muddy water. Who can be muddled yet desist. In stillness gradually become clear? Who can be serene yet persist. In motion gradually come alive? One who holds this Tao does not wish to be overfilled. Because one is not overfilled therefore one can preserve and not create anew.",
    "Attain the ultimate emptiness. Hold on to the truest tranquility. The myriad things are all active. I therefore watch their return. Everything flourishes; each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called tranquility. Tranquility is called returning to one's nature. Returning to one's nature is called constancy. Knowing constancy is called clarity. Not knowing constancy, one recklessly causes trouble. Knowing constancy is acceptance. Acceptance is impartiality. Impartiality is sovereign. Sovereign is heaven. Heaven is Tao. Tao is eternal. The self is no more, without danger.",
    'The highest rulers, people do not know they have them. The next level, people love them and praise them. The next level, people fear them. The next level, people despise them.

Reduce selfishness, decrease desires.",

So weary, like having no place to return. The people all have surplus while I alone seem lacking. I have the heart of a fool indeed - so ignorant! Ordinary people are bright, I alone am muddled. Ordinary people are scrutinizing, I alone am obtuse. So tranquil, like the ocean. So moving, as if without limits. The people all have goals and I alone am stubborn and lowly. I alone am different from them and value the nourishing mother.",

Therefore the sage holds to the one as an example for the world. Without flaunting oneself - and so is seen clearly. Without presuming oneself - and so is distinguished. Without praising oneself - and so has merit. Without boasting about oneself - and so is lasting. Because he does not contend, the world cannot contend with him. What the ancients called "the one who yields and remains whole." Were they speaking empty words? Sincerity becoming whole, and returning to oneself.',
    "Sparse speech is natural. Thus strong wind does not last all morning. Sudden rain does not last all day. What makes this so? Heaven and earth. Even heaven and earth cannot make it last. How can humans? Thus those who follow the Tao, are with the Tao. Those who follow virtue, are with virtue. Those who follow loss, are with loss. Those who are with the Tao, the Tao is also pleased to have them. Those who are with virtue, virtue is also pleased to have them. Those who are with loss, loss is also pleased to have them. Those who do not trust sufficiently, others have no trust in them.",
    "Those who are on tiptoes cannot stand. Those who straddle cannot walk. Those who flaunt themselves are not clear. Those who presume themselves are not distinguished. Those who praise themselves have no merit. Those who boast about themselves do not last. Those with the Tao call such things leftover food or tumors. They despise them. Thus, those who possess the Tao do not engage in them.",

I do not know its name. Identifying it, I call it "Tao." Forced to describe it, I call it great. Great means passing. Passing means receding. Receding means returning. Therefore the Tao is great, heaven is great, earth is great. The sovereign is also great. There are four greats in the universe and the sovereign occupies one of them. Humans follow the laws of Earth. Earth follows the laws of Heaven. Heaven follows the laws of Tao. Tao follows the laws of nature.',
    "Heaviness is the root of lightness. Quietness is the master of restlessness. Therefore the sage travels the entire day without leaving the heavy supplies. Even though there are luxurious sights he is composed and transcends beyond. How can the lord of ten thousand chariots apply himself lightly to the world? To be light is to lose one's root. To be restless is to lose one's mastery.",
    "Good traveling does not leave tracks. Good speech does not seek faults. Good reckoning does not use counters. Good closure needs no bar and yet cannot be opened. Good knot needs no rope and yet cannot be untied. Therefore sages often save others and so do not abandon anyone. They often save things and so do not abandon anything. This is called following enlightenment. Therefore the good person is the teacher of the bad person. The bad person is the resource of the good person. The one who does not value his teachers and does not love his resources, although intelligent, he is greatly confused. This is called the essential wonder.",

Know the honor, hold to the dishonor. Be the valley of the world. Being the valley of the world the eternal virtue shall be sufficient. Return to the state of plain wood. Plain wood splits, then becomes tools. The sages utilize them and then become leaders. Thus the greater whole is undivided.",
    "Those who wish to take the world and control it, I see that they cannot succeed. The world is a sacred instrument, one cannot control it. The one who controls it will fail. The one who grasps it will lose. Because all things: either lead or follow, either blow hot or cold, either have strength or weakness, either have ownership or take by force. Therefore the sage: eliminates extremes, eliminates excess, eliminates arrogance.",

Following the great army there must be an inauspicious year. A good commander achieves result, then stops, and does not dare reaching for domination. Achieves result but does not brag. Achieves result but does not flaunt. Achieves result but is not arrogant. Achieves result but only out of necessity. Achieves result but does not dominate. Things become strong and then get old. This is called contrary to the Tao. That which is contrary to the Tao soon ends.",
    "A strong military, a tool of misfortune. All things detest it. Therefore, those who possess the Tao avoid it. Honorable gentlemen, while at home, value the left. When deploying the military, value the right. The military is a tool of misfortune, not the tool of honorable gentlemen. When using it out of necessity calm detachment should be above all. Victorious but without glory. Those who glorify are delighting in the killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions upon the world. Auspicious events favor the left. Inauspicious events favor the right. The lieutenant general is positioned to the left. The major general is positioned to the right. We say that they are treated as if in a funeral. The multitude who have been killed should be mourned with sadness. Victory in war should be treated as a funeral.",
    "The Tao, eternally nameless. Its simplicity, although imperceptible, cannot be treated by the world as subservient. If a sovereign can hold on to it all will follow by themselves. The heaven and earth, together harmoniously will rain sweet dew. People won't need to force it, it will adjust by itself. In the beginning of creation, there were names. Names came to exist everywhere. One should know when to stop. Knowing when to stop, thus avoiding danger. The existence of the Tao in the world is like streams in the valley into rivers and the ocean.",

Those who know contentment are wealthy. Those who proceed vigorously have willpower. Those who do not lose their base endure. Those who die but do not perish have longevity.",
    "The great Tao is like a flood. It can flow to the left or to the right. The myriad things depend on it for life, but it never stops. It achieves its work, but does not take credit. It clothes and feeds myriad things, but does not rule over them. Ever desiring nothing it can be named insignificant. Myriad things return to it but it does not rule over them. It can be named great. Even in the end, it does not regard itself as great. That is how it can achieve its greatness.",
    "Hold the great image, the world will come. They come without harm, in harmonious peace. Music and food, passing travelers stop. The Tao that is spoken out of the mouth is bland and without flavor. Look at it, it cannot be seen. Listen to it, it cannot be heard. Use it, it cannot be exhausted.",
    "If one wishes to shrink it, one must first expand it. If one wishes to weaken it, one must first strengthen it. If one wishes to discard it, one must first promote it. If one wishes to seize it, one must first give it. This is called subtle clarity. The soft and weak overcomes the tough and strong. Fish cannot leave the depths. The sharp instruments of the state cannot be shown to the people.",
    "The Tao is constant in non-action yet there is nothing it does not do. If the sovereign can hold on to this all things shall transform themselves. Transformed, yet wishing to achieve. I shall restrain them with the simplicity of the nameless. The simplicity of the nameless they shall be without desire. Without desire, using stillness the world shall steady itself.",
    "High virtue is not virtuous, therefore it has virtue. Low virtue never loses virtue, therefore it has no virtue. High virtue takes no contrived action and acts without agenda. Low virtue takes contrived action and acts with agenda. High benevolence takes contrived action and acts without agenda. High righteousness takes contrived action and acts with agenda. High etiquette takes contrived action and upon encountering no response uses arms to pull others. Therefore, the Tao is lost, and then virtue. Virtue is lost, and then benevolence. Benevolence is lost, and then righteousness. Righteousness is lost, and then etiquette. Those who have etiquette are a thin shell of loyalty and sincerity and the beginning of chaos. Those with foreknowledge are the flowers of the Tao and the beginning of ignorance. Therefore the great person: abides in substance, and does not dwell on the thin shell, abides in the real, and does not dwell on the flower. Thus they discard that and take this.",
    "Those that attained oneness since ancient times: The sky attained oneness and thus clarity. The earth attained oneness and thus tranquility. The gods attained oneness and thus divinity. The valley attained oneness and thus abundance. The myriad things attained oneness and thus life. The rulers attained oneness and became the standard for the world. These are all from oneness. The sky, lacking clarity, would break apart. The earth, lacking tranquility, would erupt. The gods, lacking divinity, would vanish. The valley, lacking abundance, would wither. Myriad things, lacking life, would be extinct. The rulers, lacking standard, would be toppled. Therefore, the honored uses the lowly as basis. The higher uses the lower as foundation. Thus the rulers call themselves alone, bereft, and unworthy. Is this not using the lowly as basis? Is it not so? Therefore, the ultimate honor is no honor. Do not wish to be shiny like jade. Be dull like rocks.",
    "The returning is the movement of the Tao. The weak is the utilization of the Tao. The myriad things of the world are born of being. Being is born of non-being.",
    "Higher people hear of the Tao, they diligently practice it. Average people hear of the Tao, they sometimes keep it and sometimes lose it. Lower people hear of the Tao, they laugh loudly at it. If they do not laugh, it would not be the Tao. Therefore a proverb has the following: The clear Tao appears unclear. The advancing Tao appears to retreat. The smooth Tao appears uneven. High virtue appears like a valley. Great integrity appears like disgrace. Encompassing virtue appears insufficient. Building virtue appears inactive. True substance appears inconstant. The great square has no corners. The great vessel is late in completion. The great music is imperceptible in sound. The great image has no form. The Tao is hidden and nameless. Yet it is only the Tao that excels in giving and completing everything.",
    "Tao produces one. One produces two. Two produce three. Three produce myriad things. Myriad things, backed by yin and embracing yang, achieve harmony by integrating their energy. What the people dislike are alone, bereft, and unworthy. But the rulers call themselves with these terms. So with all things, appear to take loss but benefit, or receive benefit but lose. What the ancients taught I will also teach. The violent one cannot have a natural death. I will use this as the principal of teachings.",
    "The softest things of the world override the hardest things of the world. That which has no substance enters into that which has no openings. From this I know the benefits of non-attached actions. The teaching without words, the benefits of actions without attachment, are rarely matched in the world.",
    "Fame or the self, which is dearer? The self or wealth, which is greater? Gain or loss, which is more painful? Thus excessive love must lead to great spending. Excessive hoarding must lead to heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace. Knowing when to stop avoids danger. Thus one can endure indefinitely.",
    "Great perfection seems flawed. Its function is without failure. Great fullness seems empty. Its function is without exhaustion. Great straightness seems bent. Great skill seems inept. Great eloquence seems inarticulate. Movement overcomes cold. Stillness overcomes heat. Clear quietness is the standard of the world.",
    "When the world has the Tao fast horses are retired to fertilize the grounds. When the world lacks the Tao warhorses must give birth on the battlefield. There is no crime greater than greed. No disaster greater than discontentment. No fault greater than avarice. Thus the satisfaction of contentment is the lasting satisfaction.",

Thus the virtue of goodness. Those who believe, I believe them. Those who do not believe, I also believe them. Thus the virtue of belief. The sages live in the world. They cautiously merge their mind for the world. The people all pay attention with their ears and eyes. The sages care for them as children.",
    "Coming into life, entering death. The followers of life, three in ten. The followers of death, three in ten. Those whose lives are moved toward death, also three in ten. Why? Because they live lives of excess. I've heard of those who are good at cultivating life. Traveling on the road, they do not encounter rhinos or tigers. Entering into an army, they are not harmed by weapons. Rhinos have nowhere to thrust their horns. Tigers have nowhere to clasp their claws. Soldiers have nowhere to lodge their blades. Why? Because they have no place for death.",
    "Tao produces them. Virtue raises them. Things shape them. Forces perfect them. Therefore all things respect the Tao and value virtue. The respect for Tao, the value of virtue. Not due to command but to constant nature. Thus Tao produces them. Virtue raises them, grows them, educates them, perfects them, matures them, nurtures them, protects them. Produces but does not possess. Acts but does not flaunt. Nurtures but does not dominate. This is called mystic virtue.",

Live without danger all through life. Close the mouth, shut the doors. Live without toil all through life. Open the mouth, meddle in the affairs. Live without salvation all through life. Seeing details is called clarity. Holding on to the soft is called strength. Utilize the light. Return to the clarity. Leaving no disasters for the self. This is called following constancy.",
    "If I have a little knowledge, walking on the great Tao I fear only to deviate from it. The great Tao is broad and plain but people like the side paths.

Cultivate it in the country and virtue will abundant. Cultivate it in the world and virtue will be everywhere. Therefore, take yourself and observe yourself. Take the family and observe the family. Take the town and observe the town. Take the country and observe the country. Take the world and observe the world. How do I know the world as it is? By this.",

Their bones are weak, tendons are soft, but their grasp is firm. They do not know of sexual union but can manifest arousal due to the optimum of essence. They can cry the whole day and yet not be hoarse due to the optimum of harmony. Knowing harmony is said to be constancy. Knowing constancy is said to be clarity. Excessive vitality is said to be inauspicious. Mind overusing energy is said to be aggressive. Things become strong and then grow old. This is called contrary to the Tao. That which is contrary to the Tao will soon perish.",
    "Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know. Close the mouth. Shut the doors. Blunt the sharpness. Unravel the knots. Dim the glare. Mix the dust. This is called mystic oneness. They cannot obtain this and be closer. They cannot obtain this and be distant. They cannot obtain this and be benefited. They cannot obtain this and be harmed. They cannot obtain this and be valued. They cannot obtain this and be degraded. Therefore, they become honored by the world.",

With the following: When there are many restrictions in the world the people become more impoverished. When people have many sharp weapons the country becomes more chaotic. When people have many clever tricks more strange things occur. The more laws are posted the more robbers and thieves there are. Therefore the sage says: I take minimal action, and the people transform themselves. I prefer quiet, and the people right themselves. I do not interfere, and the people enrich themselves. I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves.",
    "When governing is lackluster the people are simple and honest. When governing is scrutinizing the people are shrewd and crafty. Misfortune is what fortune depends upon. Fortune is where misfortune hides beneath. Who knows their ultimate end? They have no determined outcome. Rightness reverts to become strange. Goodness reverts to become wicked. The confusion of people has lasted many long days. Therefore the sages are: Righteous without being scathing. Incorruptible without being piercing. Straightforward without being ruthless. Illuminated without being flashy.",
    "In governing people and serving Heaven there is nothing like conservation. Only with conservation is it called submitting early. Submitting early is called emphasis on accumulating virtues. Accumulating virtues means there is nothing one cannot overcome. When there is nothing that one cannot overcome one's limits are unknown. The limitations being unknown, one can possess sovereignty. With this mother principle of power, one can be everlasting. This is called deep roots and firm foundation. The Tao of longevity and lasting vision.",
    "Ruling a large country is like cooking a small fish. Using the Tao to manage the world its demons have no power. Not only do its demons have no power, its gods do not harm people. Not only do its gods not harm people, the sages also do not harm people. They both do no harm to one another so virtue merges and returns.",
    "The large country is like the lowest river. The converging point of the world. The receptive female of the world. The female always overcomes the male with serenity. Using serenity as the lower position. Thus if the large country is lower than the small country then it can take the small country. If the small country is lower than the large country then it can be taken by the large country. Thus one uses the lower position to take. The other uses the lower position to be taken. The large country only wishes to gather and protect people. The small country only wishes to join and serve people. So that both obtain what they wish the larger one should assume the lower position.",
    "The Tao is the wonder of all things. The treasure of the kind person. The protection of the unkind person. Admirable words can win the public's respect. Admirable actions can improve people. Those who are unkind, how can they be abandoned? Therefore, when crowning the Emperor and install the three ministers, although there is the offering of jade before four horses, none of it can compare to being seated in this Tao. Why did the ancients value this Tao so much? Is it not said that those who seek will find, and those with guilt will not be faulted? Therefore, it is the greatest value in the world.",
    "Act without action. Manage without meddling. Taste without tasting. Great, small, many, few. Respond to hatred with virtue. Plan difficult tasks through the simplest tasks. Achieve large tasks through the smallest tasks. The difficult tasks of the world must be handled through the simple tasks. The large tasks of the world must be handled through the small tasks. Therefore, sages never attempt great deeds all through life thus they can achieve greatness. One who makes promises lightly must deserve little trust. One who sees many easy tasks must encounter much difficulty. Therefore, sages regard things as difficult so they never encounter difficulties all through life.",
    "When it is peaceful, it is easy to maintain. When it shows no signs, it is easy to plan. When it is fragile, it is easy to break. When it is small, it is easy to scatter. Act on it when it has not yet begun. Treat it when it is not yet chaotic. A tree thick enough to embrace grows from the tiny sapling. A tower of nine levels starts from the dirt heap. A journey of a thousand miles begins beneath the feet. The one who meddles will fail. The one who grasps will lose. Therefore, sages do not meddle and thus do not fail. They do not grasp and thus do not lose. People, in handling affairs often come close to completion and fail. If they are as careful in the end as the beginning then they would have no failure. Therefore, sages desire not to desire. They do not value goods that are hard to acquire. They learn to unlearn. To redeem the fault of the people. To assist the nature of all things without daring to meddle.",
    "Those of ancient times who were adept at the Tao used it not to make people brighter, but to keep them simple. The difficulty in governing people is due to their excessive cleverness. Therefore, using cleverness to govern the state is being a thief of the state. Not using cleverness to govern the state is being a blessing of the state. Know that these two are both standards. Always knowing these standards is called Mystic Virtue. Mystic Virtue is so profound, so far-reaching it goes opposite to material things. Then it reaches great congruence.",
    "Rivers and oceans can be the kings of a hundred valleys. Because of their goodness in staying low, so they can be the kings of a hundred valleys. Thus if sages wish to be over people they must speak humbly to them. If they wish to be in front of people they must place themselves behind them. Thus the sages are positioned above but the people do not feel burdened. They are positioned in front but the people do not feel harmed. Thus the world is glad to push them forward without resentment. Because they do not contend, so the world cannot contend with them.",
    "Everyone in the world calls my Tao great as if it is beyond compare. It is only because of its greatness that it seems beyond compare. If it can be compared it would already be insignificant long ago. I have three treasures. I hold on to them and protect them. The first is called compassion. The second is called conservation. The third is called not daring to be ahead in the world. Compassionate, thus able to have courage. Conserving, thus able to reach widely. Not daring to be ahead in the world, thus able to assume leadership. Now if one has courage but discards compassion, reaches widely but discards conservation, goes ahead but discards being behind, then death! If one fights with compassion, then victory. With defense, then security. Heaven shall save them and with compassion guard them.",
    "The great generals are not warlike. The great warriors do not get angry. Those who are good at defeating enemies do not engage them. Those who are good at managing people lower themselves. It is called the virtue of non-contention. It is called the power of managing people. It is called being harmonious with heaven, the ultimate principle of the ancients.",
    "In using the military, there is a saying: I dare not be the host, but prefer to be the guest. I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to withdraw a foot. This is called marching in formation without formation. Raising arms without arms. Grappling enemies without enemies. Holding weapons without weapons. There is no greater disaster than to underestimate the enemy. Underestimating the enemy almost made me lose my treasures. So when evenly matched armies meet, the side that is compassionate shall win.",
    "My words are easy to understand, easy to practice. The world cannot understand, cannot practice. My words have basis. My actions have principle. People do not understand this therefore they do not understand me. Those who understand me are few, thus I am highly valued. Therefore the sage wears plain clothes but holds jade.",
    "To know that you do not know is highest. To not know but think you know is flawed. Only when one recognizes the fault as a fault can one be without fault. The sages are without fault because they recognize the fault as a fault. That is why they are without fault.",
    "When people no longer fear force they bring about greater force. Do not limit their place. Do not reject their livelihood. Because the ruler does not reject them therefore they do not reject the ruler. Therefore the sages: Know themselves but do not glorify themselves. Respect themselves but do not praise themselves. Thus they discard that and take this.",
    "The bold in daring will be killed. The bold in not daring will survive. Of these two, one may benefit, the other may harm. The one hated by heaven - who knows the reason? Even the sages still find this difficult. The Tao of heaven: Does not contend and yet excels in winning. Does not speak and yet excels in responding. Is not summoned and yet comes on its own. Is unhurried and yet excels in planning. The heavenly net is vast, loose, and yet does not let anything slip through.",
    "People do not fear death. How can they be threatened with death? If people are made to constantly fear death then those who act unlawfully I can capture and kill them. Who would dare? There exists a master executioner that kills. If we substitute for the master executioner to kill it is like substituting for the great carpenter to cut. Those who substitute for the great carpenter to cut, it is rare that they do not hurt their own hands.",
    "The people's hunger is due to the excess of their ruler's taxation, so they starve. The people's difficulty in being governed is due to the meddling of their ruler, so they are difficult to govern. The people's disregard for death is due to the glut in their ruler's pursuit of life, so they disregard death. Therefore those who do not strive for living are better than those who value living.",
    "While alive, the body is soft and pliant. When dead, it is hard and rigid. All living things, grass and trees, while alive, are soft and supple. When dead, become dry and brittle. Thus that which is hard and stiff is the follower of death. That which is soft and yielding is the follower of life. Therefore, an inflexible army will not win. A strong tree will be cut down. The big and forceful occupy a lowly position while the soft and pliant occupy a higher place.",
    "The Tao of heaven is like drawing a bow. Lower that which is high, raise that which is low. Reduce that which is excessive, add to that which is insufficient. The Tao of heaven reduces the excessive and adds to the insufficient. The Tao of people is not so. Reducing the insufficient in order to offer to the excessive. Who can offer their excess to the world? Only those who have the Tao. Therefore sages act without conceit, achieve without claiming credit. They do not wish to display their virtue.",
    "Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet nothing is better at overcoming the hard and strong. This is because nothing can replace it. That the weak overcomes the strong and the soft overcomes the hard, everybody in the world knows but cannot put into practice. Therefore sages say: The one who accepts the humiliation of the state is called its master. The one who accepts the misfortune of the state becomes king of the world. The truth seems like the opposite.",
    "After settling a great dispute there must be remaining resentments. How can this be considered good? Therefore the sage holds the left part of the contract but does not demand payment from the other person. Those who have virtue hold the contract. Those without virtue hold the collections. The Heavenly Tao has no favorites. It constantly gives to the kind people.",
    "Small country, few people. Let them have many weapons but not use them. Let the people regard death seriously and not migrate far away. Although they have boats and chariots they have no need to take them. Although they have armors and weapons they have no need to display them. Let the people return to tying knots and using them. Savor their food, admire their clothes. Content in their homes, happy in their customs. Neighboring countries see one another, hear the sounds of roosters and dogs from one another. The people, until they grow old and die do not go back and forth with one another.",
    "True words are not beautiful. Beautiful words are not true. Those who are good do not debate. Those who debate are not good. Those who know are not broad of knowledge. Those who are broad of knowledge do not know. Sages do not accumulate. The more they assist others, the more they possess. The more they give to others, the more they gain. The Tao of heaven benefits and does not harm. The Tao of sages assists and does not contend.",

  "James Legge": [
    "The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and unchanging name. (Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all things. Always without desire we must be found, If its deep mystery we would sound; But if desire always within us be, Its outer fringe is all that we shall see. Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful.",
    "All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the want of skill is. So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to (the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and that being before and behind give the idea of one following another. Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and conveys his instructions without the use of speech. All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership; they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a reward for the results). The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it (as an achievement). The work is done, but how no one can see; 'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be.",
    "Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming thieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is the way to keep their minds from disorder. Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones. He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from presuming to act (on it). When there is this abstinence from action, good order is universal.",
    "The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness. How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things! We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into agreement with the obscurity of others. How pure and still the Tao is, as if it would ever so continue! I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before God.",
    "Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with. May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a bellows? 'Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power; 'Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more. Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see; Your inner being guard, and keep it free.",
    "The valley spirit dies not, aye the same; The female mystery thus do we name. Its gate, from which at first they issued forth, Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth. Long and unbroken does its power remain, Used gently, and without the touch of pain.",
    "Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are able to continue and endure. Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him, and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised?",
    "The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao. The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness. And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about his low position), no one finds fault with him.",
    "It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to carry it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness. When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them safe. When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil on itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven.",
    "When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without a flaw. In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be without knowledge? (The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them. This is what is called 'The mysterious Quality' (of the Tao).",
    "The thirty spokes unite in the one nave; but it is on the empty space (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that their use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the walls) to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its use depends. Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness.",
    "Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take; Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make; The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste; The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste. Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange, Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change. Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the latter, and prefers to seek the former.",
    "Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind). What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):--this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me? Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted with it.",
    "We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it 'the Subtle.' With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain The One. Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure. Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless, and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and Indeterminable. We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao.",
    "The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be. Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water. Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise. They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete.",
    "The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end. The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay.",
    "In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them. Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers) a want of faith in them ensued (in the people). How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words! Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the people all said, 'We are as we are, of ourselves!'",
    "When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed, benevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy. When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships, filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell into disorder, loyal ministers appeared.",
    "If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers. Those three methods (of government) Thought olden ways in elegance did fail And made these names their want of worth to veil; But simple views, and courses plain and true Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew.",
    "When we renounce learning we have no troubles. The (ready) 'yes,' and (flattering) 'yea;'-- Small is the difference they display. But mark their issues, good and ill;-- What space the gulf between shall fill? What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)! The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao).",
    "The grandest forms of active force From Tao come, their only source. Who can of Tao the nature tell? Our sight it flies, our touch as well. Eluding sight, eluding touch, The forms of things all in it crouch; Eluding touch, eluding sight, There are their semblances, all right. Profound it is, dark and obscure; Things' essences all there endure. Those essences the truth enfold Of what, when seen, shall then be told. Now it is so; 'twas so of old. Its name--what passes not away; So, in their beautiful array, Things form and never know decay. How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? By this (nature of the Tao).",
    "The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty, full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he whose (desires) are many goes astray. Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self-display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him. That saying of the ancients that 'the partial becomes complete' was not vainly spoken:--all real completion is comprehended under it.",
    "Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these (two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man! Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where they fail. Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao). (But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others).",
    "He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self-conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course) of the Tao do not adopt and allow them.",
    "There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things. I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I call it The Great. Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage) king is one of them. Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is.",
    "Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of movement. Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne.",
    "The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to unloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast away anything. This is called 'Hiding the light of his procedure.' Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of (the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is called 'The utmost degree of mystery.'",
    "Who knows his manhood's strength, Yet still his female feebleness maintains; As to one channel flow the many drains, All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky. Thus he the constant excellence retains; The simple child again, free from all stains. Who knows how white attracts, Yet always keeps himself within black's shade, The pattern of humility displayed, Displayed in view of all beneath the sky; He in the unchanging excellence arrayed, Endless return to man's first state has made. Who knows how glory shines, Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale; Behold his presence in a spacious vale, To which men come from all beneath the sky. The unchanging excellence completes its tale; The simple infant man in him we hail. The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs no violent measures.",
    "If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp loses it. The course and nature of things is such that What was in front is now behind; What warmed anon we freezing find. Strength is of weakness oft the spoil; The store in ruins mocks our toil. Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy indulgence.",
    "He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course is sure to meet with its proper return. Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years. A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his mastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for mastery. When things have attained their strong maturity they become old. This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not in accordance with it soon comes to an end.",
    "Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen, hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have the Tao do not like to employ them. The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him undesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot get his will in the kingdom. On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites.",
    "The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name. Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would spontaneously submit themselves to him. Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally everywhere as of its own accord. As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error. The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys.",
    "He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will. He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity.",
    "All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left hand and on the right. All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things. All things return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest things. Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great achievements. It is through his not making himself great that he can accomplish them.",
    "To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible Tao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease. Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time). But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to, the use of it is inexhaustible.",
    "When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of his procedure).' The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong. Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the profit of a state should not be shown to the people.",
    "The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do. If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of themselves be transformed by them. If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would express the desire by the nameless simplicity. Simplicity without a name Is free from all external aim. With no desire, at rest and still, All things go right as of their will.",
    "(Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them (in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not possess them (in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing. (Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who) possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it out, and had need to be so doing. (Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared the arm and marched up to them. Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared; when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the proprieties appeared. Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity. Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other.",
    "The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are-- Heaven which by it is bright and pure; Earth rendered thereby firm and sure; Spirits with powers by it supplied; Valleys kept full throughout their void All creatures which through it do live Princes and kings who from it get The model which to all they give. All these are the results of the One (Tao). If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend; If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend; Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail; If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale; Without that life, creatures would pass away; Princes and kings, without that moral sway, However grand and high, would all decay. Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous) meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from which it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves 'Orphans,' 'Men of small virtue,' and as 'Carriages without a nave.' Is not this an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an (ordinary) stone.",
    "The movement of the Tao By contraries proceeds; And weakness marks the course Of Tao's mighty deeds. All things under heaven sprang from It as existing (and named); that existence sprang from It as non-existent (and not named).",
    "Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao, earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it. Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit to be the Tao. Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:-- 'The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack; Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back; Its even way is like a rugged track. Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise; Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes; And he has most whose lot the least supplies. Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low; Its solid truth seems change to undergo; Its largest square doth yet no corner show A vessel great, it is the slowest made; Loud is its sound, but never word it said; A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.' The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them complete.",
    "The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity (out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised by the Breath of Vacancy. What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased. What other men (thus) teach, I also teach. The violent and strong do not die their natural death. I will make this the basis of my teaching.",
    "The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose). There are few in the world who attain to the teaching without words, and the advantage arising from non-action.",
    "Or fame or life, Which do you hold more dear? Or life or wealth, To which would you adhere? Keep life and lose those other things; Keep them and lose your life:--which brings Sorrow and pain more near? Thus we may see, Who cleaves to fame Rejects what is more great; Who loves large stores Gives up the richer state. Who is content Needs fear no shame. Who knows to stop Incurs no blame. From danger free Long live shall he.",
    "Who thinks his great achievements poor Shall find his vigour long endure. Of greatest fulness, deemed a void, Exhaustion ne'er shall stem the tide. Do thou what's straight still crooked deem; Thy greatest art still stupid seem, And eloquence a stammering scream. Constant action overcomes cold; being still overcomes heat. Purity and stillness give the correct law to all under heaven.",
    "When the Tao prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung-carts. When the Tao is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands. There is no guilt greater than to sanction ambition; no calamity greater than to be discontented with one's lot; no fault greater than the wish to be getting. Therefore the sufficiency of contentment is an enduring and unchanging sufficiency.",
    "Without going outside his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking out from his window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so.",
    "He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to diminish (his doing). He diminishes it and again diminishes it, till he arrives at doing nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action, there is nothing which he does not do. He who gets as his own all under heaven does so by giving himself no trouble (with that end). If one take trouble (with that end), he is not equal to getting as his own all under heaven.",
    "The sage has no invariable mind of his own; he makes the mind of the people his mind. To those who are good (to me), I am good; and to those who are not good (to me), I am also good;--and thus (all) get to be good. To those who are sincere (with me), I am sincere; and to those who are not sincere (with me), I am also sincere;--and thus (all) get to be sincere. The sage has in the world an appearance of indecision, and keeps his mind in a state of indifference to all. The people all keep their eyes and ears directed to him, and he deals with them all as his children.",
    "Men come forth and live; they enter (again) and die. Of every ten three are ministers of life (to themselves); and three are ministers of death. There are also three in every ten whose aim is to live, but whose movements tend to the land (or place) of death. And for what reason? Because of their excessive endeavours to perpetuate life. But I have heard that he who is skilful in managing the life entrusted to him for a time travels on the land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enters a host without having to avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death.",
    "All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation. This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute. Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them. It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;--this is called its mysterious operation.",
    "(The Tao) which originated all under the sky is to be considered as the mother of them all. When the mother is found, we know what her children should be. When one knows that he is his mother's child, and proceeds to guard (the qualities of) the mother that belong to him, to the end of his life he will be free from all peril. Let him keep his mouth closed, and shut up the portals (of his nostrils), and all his life he will be exempt from laborious exertion. Let him keep his mouth open, and (spend his breath) in the promotion of his affairs, and all his life there will be no safety for him. The perception of what is small is (the secret of) clear-sightedness; the guarding of what is soft and tender is (the secret of) strength. Who uses well his light, Reverting to its (source so) bright, Will from his body ward all blight, And hides the unchanging from men's sight.",
    "If I were suddenly to become known, and (put into a position to) conduct (a government) according to the Great Tao, what I should be most afraid of would be a boastful display. The great Tao (or way) is very level and easy; but people love the by-ways. Their court(-yards and buildings) shall be well kept, but their fields shall be ill-cultivated, and their granaries very empty. They shall wear elegant and ornamented robes, carry a sharp sword at their girdle, pamper themselves in eating and drinking, and have a superabundance of property and wealth;--such (princes) may be called robbers and boasters. This is contrary to the Tao surely!",
    "What (Tao's) skilful planter plants Can never be uptorn; What his skilful arms enfold, From him can ne'er be borne. Sons shall bring in lengthening line, Sacrifices to his shrine. Tao when nursed within one's self, His vigour will make true; And where the family it rules What riches will accrue! The neighbourhood where it prevails In thriving will abound; And when 'tis seen throughout the state, Good fortune will be found. Employ it the kingdom o'er, And men thrive all around. In this way the effect will be seen in the person, by the observation of different cases; in the family; in the neighbourhood; in the state; and in the kingdom. How do I know that this effect is sure to hold thus all under the sky? By this (method of observation).",
    "He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the Tao) is like an infant. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him. (The infant's) bones are weak and its sinews soft, but yet its grasp is firm. It knows not yet the union of male and female, and yet its virile member may be excited;--showing the perfection of its physical essence. All day long it will cry without its throat becoming hoarse;--showing the harmony (in its constitution). To him by whom this harmony is known, (The secret of) the unchanging (Tao) is shown, And in the knowledge wisdom finds its throne. All life-increasing arts to evil turn; Where the mind makes the vital breath to burn, (False) is the strength, (and o'er it we should mourn.) When things have become strong, they (then) become old, which may be said to be contrary to the Tao. Whatever is contrary to the Tao soon ends.",
    "He who knows (the Tao) does not (care to) speak (about it); he who is (ever ready to) speak about it does not know it. He (who knows it) will keep his mouth shut and close the portals (of his nostrils). He will blunt his sharp points and unravel the complications of things; he will attemper his brightness, and bring himself into agreement with the obscurity (of others). This is called 'the Mysterious Agreement.' (Such an one) cannot be treated familiarly or distantly; he is beyond all consideration of profit or injury; of nobility or meanness:--he is the noblest man under heaven.",
    "A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's own (only) by freedom from action and purpose. How do I know that it is so? By these facts:--In the kingdom the multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the more thieves and robbers there are. Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to the primitive simplicity.'",
    "The government that seems the most unwise, Oft goodness to the people best supplies; That which is meddling, touching everything, Will work but ill, and disappointment bring. Misery!--happiness is to be found by its side! Happiness!--misery lurks beneath it! Who knows what either will come to in the end? Shall we then dispense with correction? The (method of) correction shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn become evil. The delusion of the people (on this point) has indeed subsisted for a long time. Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its angles); (like) a corner which injures no one (with its sharpness). He is straightforward, but allows himself no license; he is bright, but does not dazzle.",
    "For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like moderation. It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return (to man's normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state. He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His case is like that (of the plant) of which we say that its roots are deep and its flower stalks firm:--this is the way to secure that its enduring life shall long be seen.",
    "Governing a great state is like cooking small fish. Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy. It is not that those manes have not that spiritual energy, but it will not be employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but neither does the ruling sage hurt them. When these two do not injuriously affect each other, their good influences converge in the virtue (of the Tao).",
    "What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down-flowing (stream);--it becomes the centre to which tend (all the small states) under heaven. (To illustrate from) the case of all females:--the female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement. Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour. The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself.",
    "Tao has of all things the most honoured place. No treasures give good men so rich a grace; Bad men it guards, and doth their ill efface. (Its) admirable words can purchase honour; (its) admirable deeds can raise their performer above others. Even men who are not good are not abandoned by it. Therefore when the sovereign occupies his place as the Son of Heaven, and he has appointed his three ducal ministers, though (a prince) were to send in a round symbol-of-rank large enough to fill both the hands, and that as the precursor of the team of horses (in the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of) this Tao, which one might present on his knees. Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape (from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all under heaven consider it the most valuable thing.",
    "(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting; to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great, and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness. (The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they are easy, and does things that would become great while they are small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things. He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult. Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so never has any difficulties.",
    "That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very small is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun. The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey of a thousand li commenced with a single step. He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act (so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and therefore does not lose his bold. (But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them. Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by. Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own).",
    "The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and ignorant. The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing. He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call the mysterious excellence (of a governor). Deep and far-reaching is such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him.",
    "That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower than they;--it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person behind them. In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an injury to them. Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive with him.",
    "All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears to be inferior (to other systems of teaching). Now it is just its greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any other (system), for long would its smallness have been known! But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking from taking precedence of others. With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;--(of all which the end is) death. Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very) gentleness protecting him.",
    "He who in (Tao's) wars has skill Assumes no martial port; He who fights with most good will To rage makes no resort. He who vanquishes yet still Keeps from his foes apart; He whose hests men most fulfil Yet humbly plies his art. Thus we say, 'He ne'er contends, And therein is his might.' Thus we say, 'Men's wills he bends, That they with him unite.' Thus we say, 'Like Heaven's his ends, No sage of old more bright.'",
    "A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a foot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks; baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the enemy where there is no enemy. There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores (the situation) conquers.",
    "My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise them. There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It is because they do not know these, that men do not know me. They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth, while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom.",
    "To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest (attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease. It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease. He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it.",
    "When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which is their great dread will come on them. Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on. It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not arise. Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes choice of the former.",
    "He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in his not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But When Heaven's anger smites a man, Who the cause shall truly scan? On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the former case). It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape.",
    "The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to) frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death, and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death, who would dare to do wrong? There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter, does not cut his own hands!",
    "The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer famine. The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive) agency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this that they are difficult to govern. The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on it.",
    "Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered. Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life. Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms, (and thereby invites the feller.) Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that of what is soft and weak is above.",
    "May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method of) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency. It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance. Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao! Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:--he does not wish to display his superiority.",
    "There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;--for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed. Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice. Therefore a sage has said, 'He who accepts his state's reproach, Is hailed therefore its altars' lord; To him who bears men's direful woes They all the name of King accord.' Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical.",
    "When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the other)? Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the (speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the conditions favourable to himself. In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man.",
    "In a little state with a small population, I would so order it, that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove elsewhere (to avoid it). Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they should have no occasion to don or use them. I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead of the written characters). They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common (simple) ways sources of enjoyment. There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any intercourse with it.",
    "Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it. The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that he gives to others, the more does he have himself. With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive.",

  "Ursula K. Le Guin": [
    "The way you can go isn't the real way. The name you can say isn't the real name. Heaven and earth begin in the unnamed: name's the mother of the ten thousand things. So the unwanting soul sees what's hidden, and the ever-wanting soul sees only what it wants. Two things, one origin, but different in name, whose identity is mystery. Mystery of all mysteries! The door to the hidden.",
    "Everybody on earth knowing that beauty is beautiful makes ugliness. Everybody knowing that goodness is good makes wickedness. For being and nonbeing arise together; hard and easy complete each other; long and short shape each other; high and low depend on each other; note and voice make the music together; before and after follow each other. That's why the wise soul does without doing, teaches without talking. The things of this world exist, they are; you can't refuse them. To bear and not to own; to act and not lay claim; to do the work and let it go: for just letting it go is what makes it stay.",
    "Not praising the praiseworthy keeps people uncompetitive. Not prizing rare treasures keeps people from stealing. Not looking at the desirable keeps the mind quiet. So the wise soul governing people would empty their minds, fill their bellies, weaken their wishes, strengthen their bones, keep people unknowing, unwanting, keep the ones who do know from doing anything. When you do not-doing, nothing's out of order.",
    "The way is empty, used, but not used up. Deep, yes! ancestral to the ten thousand things. Blunting edge, loosing bond, dimming light, the way is the dust of the way. Quiet, yes, and likely to endure. Whose child? born before the gods.",
    "Heaven and earth aren't humane. To them the ten thousand things are straw dogs. Wise souls aren't humane. To them the hundred families are straw dogs. Heaven and earth act as a bellows: Empty yet structured, it moves, inexhaustibly giving.",
    "The valley spirit never dies. Call it the mystery, the woman. The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven. Forever this endures, forever. And all its uses are easy.",
    "Heaven will last, earth will endure. How can they last so long? They don't exist for themselves and so can go on and on. So wise souls leaving self behind move forward, and setting self aside stay centered. Why let the self go? To keep what the soul needs.",
    "True goodness is like water. Water's good for everything. It doesn't compete. It goes right to the low loathsome places, and so finds the way. For a house, the good thing is level ground. In thinking, depth is good. The good of giving is magnanimity; of speaking, honesty; of government, order. The good of work is skill, and of action, timing. No competition, so no blame.",
    "Brim-fill the bowl, it'll spill over. Keep sharpening the blade, you'll soon blunt it. Nobody can protect a house full of gold and jade. Wealth, status, pride, are their own ruin. To do good, work well, and lie low is the way of the blessing.",
    "Can you keep your soul in its body, hold fast to the one, and so learn to be whole? Can you center your energy, be soft, tender, and so learn to be a baby? Can you keep the deep water still and clear, so it reflects without blurring? Can you love people and run things, and do so by not doing? Opening, closing the Gate of Heaven, can you be like a bird with her nestlings? Piercing bright through the cosmos, can you know by not knowing? To give birth, to nourish, to bear and not to own, to act and not lay claim, to lead and not to rule: this is mysterious power.",
    "Thirty spokes meet in the hub. Where the wheel isn't is where it's useful. Hollowed out, clay makes a pot. Where the pot's not is where it's useful. Cut doors and windows to make a room. Where the room isn't, there's room for you. So the profit in what is is in the use of what isn't.",
    "The five colors blind our eyes. The five notes deafen our ears. The five flavors dull our taste. Racing, chasing, hunting, drives people crazy. Trying to get rich ties people in knots. So the wise soul watches with the inner not the outward eye, letting that go, keeping this.",
    "To be in favor or disgrace is to live in fear. To take the body seriously is to admit one can suffer. What does that mean, to be in favor or disgrace is to live in fear? Favor debases: we fear to lose it, fear to win it. So to be in favor or disgrace is to live in fear. What does that mean, to take the body seriously is to admit one can suffer? I suffer because I'm a body; if I weren't a body, how could I suffer? So people who set their bodily good before the public good could be entrusted with the commonwealth, and people who treated the body politic as gently as their own body would be worthy to govern the commonwealth.",
    "Look at it: nothing to see. Call it colorless. Listen to it: nothing to hear. Call it soundless. Reach for it: nothing to hold. Call it intangible. Triply undifferentiated, it merges into oneness, not bright above, not dark below. Never, oh! never can it be named. It reverts, it returns to unbeing. Call it the form of the unformed, the image of no image. Call it unthinkable thought. Face it: no face. Follow it: no end. Holding fast to the old Way, we can live in the present. Mindful of the ancient beginnings, we hold the thread of the Tao.",
    "Once upon a time people who knew the Way were subtle, spiritual, mysterious, penetrating, unfathomable. Since they're inexplicable I can only say what they seemed like: Cautious, oh yes, as if wading through a winter river. Alert, as if afraid of the neighbors. Polite and quiet, like houseguests. Elusive, like melting ice. Blank, like uncut wood. Empty, like valleys. Mysterious, oh yes, they were like troubled water. Who can by stillness, little by little make what is troubled grow clear? Who can by movement, little by little make what is still grow quick? To follow the Way is not to need fulfillment. Unfulfilled, one may live on needing no renewal.",
    "Be completely empty. Be perfectly serene. The ten thousand things arise together; in their arising is their return. Now they flower, and flowering sink homeward, returning to the root. The return to the root is peace. Peace: to accept what must be, to know what endures. In that knowledge is wisdom. Without it, ruin, disorder. To know what endures is to be openhearted, magnanimous, regal, blessed, following the Tao, the way that endures forever. The body comes to its ending, but there is nothing to fear.",
    "True leaders are hardly known to their followers. Next after them are the leaders the people know and admire; after them, those they fear; after them, those they despise. To give no trust is to get no trust. When the work's done right, with no fuss or boasting, ordinary people say, Oh, we did it.",
    "In the degradation of the great way come benevolence and righteousness. With the exaltation of learning and prudence comes immense hypocrisy. The disordered family is full of dutiful children and parents. The disordered society is full of loyal patriots.",
    "Stop being holy, forget being prudent, it'll be a hundred times better for everyone. Stop being altruistic, forget being righteous, people will remember what family feeling is. Stop planning, forget making a profit, there won't be any thieves and robbers. But even these three rules needn't be followed; what works reliably is to know the raw silk, hold the uncut wood. Need little, want less. Forget the rules. Be untroubled.",
    "How much difference between yes and no? What difference between good and bad? What the people fear must be feared. O desolation! Not yet, not yet has it reached its limit! Everybody's cheerful, cheerful as if at a party, or climbing a tower in springtime. And here I sit unmoved, clueless, like a child, a baby too young to smile. Forlorn, forlorn. Like a homeless person. Most people have plenty. I'm the one that's poor, a fool right through. Ignorant, ignorant. Most people are so bright. I'm the one that's dull. Most people are so keen. I don't have the answers. Oh, I'm desolate, at sea, adrift, without harbor. Everybody has something to do. I'm the clumsy one, out of place. I'm the different one, for my food is the milk of the mother.",
    "The greatest power is the gift of following the Way alone. How the Way does things is hard to grasp, elusive. Elusive, yes, hard to grasp, yet there are thoughts in it. Hard to grasp, yes, elusive, yet there are things in it. Hard to make out, yes, and obscure, yet there is spirit in it, veritable spirit. There is certainty in it. From long, long ago till now it has kept its name. So it saw the beginning of everything. How do I know anything about the beginning? By this.",
    "Be broken to be whole. Twist to be straight. Be empty to be full. Wear out to be renewed. Have little and gain much. Have much and get confused. So wise souls hold to the one, and test all things against it. Not showing themselves, they shine forth. Not justifying themselves, they're self-evident. Not praising themselves, they're accomplished. Not competing, they have in all the world no competitor. What they used to say in the old days, âBe broken to be whole,â was that mistaken? Truly, to be whole is to return.",
    "Nature doesn't make long speeches. A whirlwind doesn't last all morning. A cloudburst doesn't last all day. Who makes the wind and rain? Heaven and earth do. If heaven and earth don't go on and on, certainly people don't need to. The people who work with Tao are Tao people, they belong to the Way. People who work with power belong to power. People who work with loss belong to what's lost. Give yourself to the Way and you'll be at home on the Way. Give yourself to power and you'll be at home in power. Give yourself to loss and when you're lost you'll be at home. To give no trust is to get no trust.",
    "You can't keep standing on tiptoe or walk in leaps and bounds. You can't shine by showing off or get ahead by pushing. Self-satisfied people do no good, self-promoters never grow up. Such stuff is to the Tao as garbage is to food or a tumor to the body, hateful. The follower of the Way avoids it.",
    "There is something that contains everything. Before heaven and earth it is. Oh, it is still, unbodied, all on its own, unchanging, all-pervading, ever-moving. So it can act as the mother of all things. Not knowing its real name, we only call it the Way. If it must be named, let its name be Great. Greatness means going on, going on means going far, and going far means turning back. So they say: 'The Way is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and humankind is great; four greatnesses in the world, and humanity is one of them.' People follow earth, earth follows heaven, heaven follows the Way, the Way follows what is.",
    "Heavy is the root of light. Still is the master of moving. So wise souls make their daily march with the heavy baggage wagon. Only when safe in a solid, quiet house do they lay care aside. How can a lord of ten thousand chariots let his own person weigh less in the balance than his land? Lightness will lose him his foundation, movement will lose him his mastery.",
    "Good walkers leave no track. Good talkers don't stammer. Good counters don't use their fingers. The best door's unlocked and unopened. The best knot's not in a rope and can't be untied. So wise souls are good at caring for people, never turning their back on anyone. They're good at looking after things, never turning their back on anything. There's a light hidden here. Good people teach people who aren't good yet; the less good are the makings of the good. Anyone who doesn't respect a teacher or cherish a student may be clever, but has gone astray. There's a deep mystery here.",
    "Knowing man and staying woman, be the riverbed of the world. Being the world's riverbed of eternal unfailing power is to go back again to be newborn. Knowing light and staying dark, be a pattern to the world. Being the world's pattern of eternal unerring power is to go back again to boundlessness. Knowing glory and staying modest, be the valley of the world. Being the world's valley of eternal inexhaustible power is to go back again to the natural. Natural wood is cut up and made into useful things. Wise souls are used to make into leaders. Just so, a great carving is done without cutting.",
    "Those who think to win the world by doing something to it, I see them come to grief. For the world is a sacred object. Nothing is to be done to it. To do anything to it is to damage it. To seize it is to lose it. Under heaven some things lead, some follow, some blow hot, some cold, some are strong, some weak, some are fulfilled, some fail. So the wise soul keeps away from the extremes, excess, extravagance.",
    "A Taoist wouldn't advise a ruler to use force of arms for conquest; that tactic backfires. Where the army marched grow thorns and thistles. After the war come the bad harvests. Good leaders prosper, that's all, not presuming on victory. They prosper without boasting, or domineering, or arrogance, prosper because they can't help it, prosper without violence. Things flourish then perish. Not the Way. What's not the Way soon ends.",
    "Even the best weapon is an unhappy tool, hateful to living things. So the follower of the Way stays away from it. Weapons are unhappy tools, not chosen by thoughtful people, to be used only when there is no choice, and with a calm, still mind, without enjoyment. To enjoy using weapons is to enjoy killing people, and to enjoy killing people is to lose your share in the common good. It is right that the murder of many people be mourned and lamented. It is right that a victor in war be received with funeral ceremonies.",
    "The way goes on forever nameless. Uncut wood, nothing important, yet nobody under heaven dare try to carve it. If rulers and leaders could use it, the ten thousand things would gather in homage, heaven and earth would drop sweet dew, and people, without being ordered, would be fair to one another. To order, to govern, is to begin naming; when names proliferate it's time to stop. If you know when to stop you're in no danger. The Way in the world is as a stream to a valley, a river to the sea.",
    "Knowing other people is intelligence, knowing yourself is wisdom. Overcoming others takes strength, overcoming yourself takes greatness. Contentment is wealth. Boldly pushing forward takes resolution. Staying put keeps you in position. To live till you die is to live long enough.",
    "The Great Way runs to left, to right, the ten thousand things depending on it, living on it, accepted by it. Doing its work, it goes unnamed. Clothing and feeding the ten thousand things, it lays no claim on them and asks nothing of them. Call it a small matter. The ten thousand things return to it, though it lays no claim on them. Call it great. So the wise soul without great doings achieves greatness.",
    "Hold fast to the great thought and all the world will come to you, harmless, peaceable, serene. Walking around, we stop for music, for food. But if you taste the Way it's flat, insipid. It looks like nothing much, it sounds like nothing much. And yet you can't get enough of it.",
    "What seeks to shrink must first have grown; what seeks weakness surely was strong. What seeks its ruin must first have risen; what seeks to take has surely given. This is called the small dark light: the soft, the weak prevail over the hard, the strong. Fish should stay underwater: the real means of rule should be kept dark.",
    "The Way never does anything, and everything gets done. If those in power could hold to the Way, the ten thousand things would look after themselves. If even so they tried to act, I'd quiet them with the nameless, the natural. In the unnamed, in the unshapen, is not wanting. In not wanting is stillness. In stillness all under heaven rests.",
    "Great power, not clinging to power, has true power. Lesser power, clinging to power, lacks true power. Great power, doing nothing, has nothing to do. Lesser power, doing nothing, has an end in view. The good the truly good do has no end in view. The right the very righteous do has an end in view. And those who act in true obedience to law roll up their sleeves and make the disobedient obey. So: when we lose the Way we find power; losing power we find goodness; losing goodness we find righteousness; losing righteousness we're left with obedience. Obedience to law is the dry husk of loyalty and good faith. Opinion is the barren flower of the Way, the beginning of ignorance. So great-minded people abide in the kernel not the husk, in the fruit not the flower, letting the one go, keeping the other.",
    "Those who of old got to be whole: Heaven through its wholeness is pure; earth through its wholeness is steady; spirit through its wholeness is potent; the valley through its wholeness flows with rivers; the ten thousand things through their wholeness live; rulers through their wholeness have authority. Their wholeness makes them what they are. Without what makes it pure, heaven would disintegrate; without what steadies it, earth would crack apart; without what makes it potent, spirit would fail; without what fills it, the valley would run dry; without what quickens them, the ten thousand things would die; without what authorizes them, rulers would fall. The root of the noble is in the common, the high stands on what's below. Princes and kings call themselves 'orphans, widowers, beggars,' to get themselves rooted in the dirt. A multiplicity of riches is poverty. Jade is praised as precious, but its strength is being stone.",
    "Return is how the Way moves. Weakness is how the Way works. Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things are born of being. Being is born of nothing.",
    "Thoughtful people hear about the Way and try hard to follow it. Ordinary people hear about the Way and wander onto it and off it. Thoughtless people hear about the Way and make jokes about it. It wouldn't be the Way if there weren't jokes about it. So they say: The Way's brightness looks like darkness; advancing on the Way feels like retreating; the plain Way seems hard going. The height of power seems a valley; the amplest power seems not enough; the firmest power seems feeble. Perfect whiteness looks dirty. The pure and simple looks chaotic. The great square has no corners. The great vessel is never finished. The great tone is barely heard. The great thought can't be thought. The Way is hidden in its namelessness. But only the Way begins, sustains, fulfills.",
    "The Way bears one. The one bears two. The two bear three. The three bear the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things carry the yin on their shoulders and hold in their arms the yang, whose interplay of energy makes harmony. People despise orphans, widowers, outcasts. Yet that's what kings and rulers call themselves. Whatever you lose, you've won. Whatever you win, you've lost. What others teach, I say too: violence and aggression destroy themselves. My teaching rests on that.",
    "What's softest in the world rushes and runs over what's hardest in the world. The immaterial enters the impenetrable. So I know the good in not doing. The wordless teaching, the profit in not doing - not many people understand it.",
    "Which is nearer, name or self? Which is dearer, self or wealth? Which gives more pain, loss or gain? All you grasp will be thrown away. All you hoard will be utterly lost. Contentment keeps disgrace away. Restraint keeps you out of danger so you can go on for a long, long time.",
    "What's perfectly whole seems flawed, but you can use it forever. What's perfectly full seems empty, but you can't use it up. True straightness looks crooked. Great skill looks clumsy. Real eloquence seems to stammer. To be comfortable in the cold, keep moving; to be comfortable in the heat, hold still; to be comfortable in the world, stay calm and clear.",
    "When the world's on the Way, they use horses to haul manure. When the world gets off the Way, they breed warhorses on the common. The greatest evil: wanting more. The worst luck: discontent. Greed's the curse of life. To know enough's enough is enough to know.",
    "You don't have to go out the door to know what goes on in the world. You don't have to look out the window to see the way of heaven. The farther you go, the less you know. So the wise soul doesn't go, but knows; doesn't look, but sees; doesn't do, but gets it done.",
    "Studying and learning daily you grow larger. Following the Way daily you shrink. You get smaller and smaller. So you arrive at not doing. You do nothing and nothing's not done. To run things, be undiplomatic. No diplomat is fit to run things.",
    "The wise have no mind of their own, finding it in the minds of ordinary people. They're good to good people and they're good to bad people. Power is goodness. They trust people of good faith and they trust people of bad faith. Power is trust. They mingle their life with the world, they mix their mind up with the world. Ordinary people look after them. Wise souls are children.",
    "To look for life is to find death. The thirteen organs of our living are the thirteen organs of our dying. Why are the organs of our life where death enters us? Because we hold too hard to living. So I've heard if you live in the right way, when you cross country you needn't fear to meet a mad bull or a tiger; when you're in a battle you needn't fear the weapons. The bull would find nowhere to jab its horns, the tiger nowhere to stick its claws, the sword nowhere for its point to go. Why? Because there's nowhere in you for death to enter.",
    "The Way bears them; power nurtures them; their own being shapes them; their own energy completes them. And not one of the ten thousand things fails to hold the Way sacred or to obey its power. Their reverence for the Way and obedience to its power are unforced and always natural. For the Way gives them life; its power nourishes them, mothers and feeds them, completes and matures them, looks after them, protects them. To have without possessing, do without claiming, lead without controlling: this is mysterious power.",
    "The beginning of everything is the mother of everything. Truly to know the mother is to know her children, and truly to know the children is to turn back to the mother. The body comes to its ending but there is nothing to fear. Close the openings, shut the doors, and to the end of life nothing will trouble you. Open the openings, be busy with business, and to the end of life nothing can help you. Insight sees the insignificant. Strength knows how to yield. Use the way's light, return to its insight, and so keep from going too far. That's how to practice what's forever.",
    "If my mind's modest, I walk the great way. Arrogance is all I fear. The great way is low and plain, but people like shortcuts over the mountains. The palace is full of splendor and the fields are full of weeds and the granaries are full of nothing. People wearing ornaments and fancy clothes, carrying weapons, drinking a lot and eating a lot, having a lot of things, a lot of money: shameless thieves. Surely their way isn't the way.",
    "Well planted is not uprooted, well kept is not lost. The offerings of the generations to the ancestors will not cease. To follow the way yourself is real power. To follow it in the family is abundant power. To follow it in the community is steady power. To follow it in the whole country is lasting power. To follow it in the world is universal power. So in myself I see what self is, in my household I see what family is, in my town I see what community is, in my nation I see what a country is, in the world I see what is under heaven. How do I know the world is so? By this.",
    "Being full of power is like being a baby. Scorpions don't sting, tigers don't attack, eagles don't strike. Soft bones, weak muscles, but a firm grasp. Ignorant of the intercourse of man and woman, yet the baby penis is erect. True and perfect energy! All day long screaming and crying, but never getting hoarse. True and perfect harmony! To know harmony is to know what's eternal. To know what's eternal is enlightenment. Increase of life is full of portent: the strong heart exhausts the vital breath. The full-grown is on the edge of age. Not the Way. What's not the Way soon dies.",
    "Who knows doesn't talk. Who talks doesn't know. Closing the openings, shutting doors, blunting edge, loosing bond, dimming light, be one with the dust of the way. So you come to the deep sameness. Then you can't be controlled by love or by rejection. You can't be controlled by profit or by loss. You can't be controlled by praise or by humiliation. Then you have honor under heaven.",
    "Run the country by doing what's expected. Win the war by doing the unexpected. Control the world by doing nothing. How do I know that? By this. The more restrictions and prohibitions in the world, the poorer people get. The more experts the country has the more of a mess it's in. The more ingenious the skillful are, the more monstrous their inventions. The louder the call for law and order, the more the thieves and con men multiply. So a wise leader might say: I practice inaction, and the people look after themselves. I love to be quiet, and the people themselves find justice. I don't do business, and the people prosper on their own. I don't have wants, and the people themselves are uncut wood.",
    "When the government's dull and confused, the people are placid. When the government's sharp and keen, the people are discontented. Alas! misery lies under happiness, and happiness sits on misery, alas! Who knows where it will end? Nothing is certain. The normal changes into the monstrous, the fortunate into the unfortunate, and our bewilderment goes on and on. And so the wise shape without cutting, square without sawing, true without forcing. They are the light that does not shine.",
    "In looking after your life and following the way, gather spirit. Gather spirit early, and so redouble power, and so become invulnerable. Invulnerable, unlimited, you can do what you like with material things. But only if you hold to the Mother of things will you do it for long. Have deep roots, a strong trunk. Live long by looking long.",
    "Rule a big country the way you cook a small fish. If you keep control by following the Way, troubled spirits won't act up. They won't lose their immaterial strength, but they won't harm people with it, nor will wise souls come to harm. And so, neither harming the other, these powers will come together in unity.",
    "The polity of greatness runs downhill like a river to the sea, joining with everything, woman to everything. By stillness the woman may always dominate the man, lying quiet underneath him. So a great country submitting to small ones, dominates them; so small countries, submitting to a great one, dominate it. Lie low to be on top, be on top by lying low.",
    "The way is the hearth and home of the ten thousand things. Good souls treasure it, lost souls find shelter in it. Fine words are for sale, fine deeds go cheap; even worthless people can get them. So, at the coronation of the Son of Heaven when the Three Ministers take office, you might race out in a four-horse chariot to offer a jade screen; but wouldn't it be better to sit still and let the Way be your offering? Why was the Way honored in the old days? Wasn't it said: Seek, you'll find it. Hide, it will shelter you. So it was honored under heaven.",
    "Do without doing. Act without action. Savor the flavorless. Treat the small as large, the few as many. Meet injury with the power of goodness. Study the hard while it's easy. Do big things while they're small. The hardest jobs in the world start out easy, the great affairs of the world start small. So the wise soul, by never dealing with great things, gets great things done. Now, since taking things too lightly makes them worthless, and taking things too easy makes them hard, the wise soul, by treating the easy as hard, doesn't find anything hard.",
    "It's easy to keep hold of what hasn't stirred, easy to plan what hasn't occurred. It's easy to shatter delicate things, easy to scatter little things. Do things before they happen. Get them straight before they get mixed up. The tree you can't reach your arms around grew from a tiny seedling. The nine-story tower rises from a heap of clay. The ten-thousand-mile journey begins beneath your foot. Do, and do wrong; Hold on, and lose. Not doing, the wise soul doesn't do it wrong, and not holding on, doesn't lose it. (In all their undertakings, it's just as they're almost finished that people go wrong. Mind the end as the beginning, then it won't go wrong.) That's why the wise want not to want, care nothing for hard-won treasures, learn not to be learned, turn back to what people overlooked. They go along with things as they are, but don't presume to act.",
    "Once upon a time those who ruled according to the Way didn't use it to make people knowing but to keep them unknowing. People get hard to manage when they know too much. Whoever rules by intellect is a curse upon the land. Whoever rules by ignorance is a blessing on it. To understand these things is to have a pattern and a model, and to understand the pattern and the model is mysterious power. Mysterious power goes deep. It reaches far. It follows things back, clear back to the great oneness.",
    "Lakes and rivers are lords of the hundred valleys. Why? Because they'll go lower. So they're the lords of the hundred valleys. Just so, a wise soul, wanting to be above other people, talks to them from below and to guide them follows them. And so the wise soul predominates without dominating, and leads without misleading. And people don't get tired of enjoying and praising one who, not competing, has in all the world no competitor.",
    "Everybody says my way is great but improbable. All greatness is improbable. What's probable is tedious and petty. I have three treasures. I keep and treasure them. The first, mercy, the second, moderation, the third, modesty. If you're merciful you can be brave, if you're moderate you can be generous, and if you don't presume to lead you can lead the high and mighty. But to be brave without compassion, or generous without self-restraint, or to take the lead, is fatal. Compassion wins the battle and holds the fort; it is the bulwark set around those heaven helps.",
    "The best captain doesn't rush in front. The fiercest fighter doesn't bluster. The big winner isn't competing. The best boss takes a low footing. This is the power of noncompetition. This is the right use of ability. To follow heaven's lead has always been the best way.",
    "The expert in warfare says: Rather than dare make the attack I'd take the attack; rather than dare advance an inch I'd retreat a foot. It's called marching without marching, rolling up your sleeves without flexing your muscles, being armed without weapons, giving the attacker no opponent. Nothing's worse than attacking what yields. To attack what yields is to throw away the prize. So, when matched armies meet, the one who comes to grief is the true victor.",
    "My words are so easy to understand, so easy to follow, and yet nobody in the world understands or follows them. Words come from an ancestry, deeds from a mastery: when these are unknown, so am I. In my obscurity is my value. That's why the wise wear their jade under common clothes.",
    "To know without knowing is best. Not knowing without knowing it is sick. To be sick of sickness is the only cure. The wise aren't sick. They're sick of sickness, so they're well.",
    "When we don't fear what we should fear we are in fearful danger. We ought not to live in narrow houses, we ought not to do stupid work. If we don't accept stupidity we won't act stupidly. So, wise souls know but don't show themselves, look after but don't prize themselves, letting the one go, keeping the other.",
    "Brave daring leads to death. Brave caution leads to life. The choice can be the right one or the wrong one. Who will interpret the judgment of heaven? Even the wise soul finds it hard. The way of heaven doesn't compete yet wins handily, doesn't speak yet answers fully, doesn't summon yet attracts. It acts perfectly easily. The net of heaven is vast, vast, wide-meshed, yet misses nothing.",
    "When normal, decent people don't fear death, how can you use death to frighten them? Even when they have a normal fear of death, who of us dare take and kill the one who doesn't? When people are normal and decent and death-fearing, there's always an executioner. To take the place of that executioner is to take the place of the great carpenter. People who cut the great carpenter's wood seldom get off with their hands unhurt.",
    "People are starving. The rich gobble taxes, that's why people are starving. People rebel. The rich oppress them, that's why people rebel. People hold life cheap. The rich make it too costly, that's why people hold it cheap. But those who don't live for the sake of living are worth more than the wealth-seekers.",
    "Living people are soft and tender. Corpses are hard and stiff. The ten thousand things, the living grass, the trees, are soft, pliant. Dead, they're dry and brittle. So hardness and stiffness go with death; tenderness, softness, go with life. And the hard sword fails, the stiff tree's felled. The hard and great go under. The soft and weak stay up.",
    "The Way of heaven is like a bow bent to shoot: its top end brought down, its lower end raised up. It brings the high down, lifts the low, takes from those who have, gives to those who have not. Such is the Way of heaven, taking from people who have, giving to people who have not. Not so the human way: it takes from those who have not to fill up those who have. Who has enough to fill up everybody? Only those who have the Way. So the wise do without claiming, achieve without asserting, wishing not to show their worth.",
    "Nothing in the world is as soft, as weak, as water; nothing else can wear away the hard, the strong, and remain unaltered. Soft overcomes hard, weak overcomes strong. Everybody knows it, nobody uses the knowledge. So the wise say: By bearing common defilements you become a sacrificer at the altar of earth; by bearing common evils you become a lord of the world. Right words sound wrong.",
    "After a great enmity is settled some enmity always remains. How to make peace? Wise souls keep their part of the contract and don't make demands on others. People whose power is real fulfill their obligations; people whose power is hollow insist on their claims. The Way of heaven plays no favorites. It stays with the good.",
    "Let there be a little country without many people. Let them have tools that do the work of ten or a hundred, and never use them. Let them be mindful of death and disinclined to long journeys. They'd have ships and carriages, but no place to go. They'd have armor and weapons, but no parades. Instead of writing, they might go back to using knotted cords. They'd enjoy eating, take pleasure in clothes, be happy with their houses, devoted to their customs.",
    "True words aren't charming, charming words aren't true. Good people aren't contentious, contentious people aren't good. People who know aren't learned, learned people don't know. Wise souls don't hoard; the more they do for others the more they have, the more they give the richer they are. The Way of heaven profits without destroying. Doing without outdoing is the Way of the wise. The next little country might be so close the people could hear cocks crowing and dogs barking there, but they'd get old and die without ever having been there.",

  "D. C. Lau": [
    "The way that can be spoken of Is not the constant way; The name that can be named Is not the constant name. The nameless was the beginning of heaven and earth; The named was the mother of the myriad creatures. Hence always rid yourself of desires in order to observe its secrets; But always allow yourself to have desires in order to observe its manifestations. These two are the same But diverge in name as they issue forth. Being the same they are called mysteries, Mystery upon mystery - The gateway of the manifold secrets.",
    "The whole world recognizes the beautiful as the beautiful, yet this is only the ugly; the whole world recognizes the good as the good, yet this is only the bad. Thus Something and Nothing produce each other; The difficult and the easy complement each other; The long and the short off-set each other; The high and the low incline towards each other; Note and sound harmonize with each other; Before and after follow each other. Therefore the sage keeps to the deed that consists in taking no action and practises the teaching that uses no words. The myriad creatures rise from it yet it claims no authority; It gives them life yet claims no possession; It benefits them yet exacts no gratitude; It accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit. It is because it lays claim to no merit That its merit never deserts it.",
    "Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention; not to value goods which are hard to come by will keep them from theft; not to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind. Therefore in governing the people, the sage empties their minds but fills their bellies, weakens their wills but strengthens their bones. He always keeps them innocent of knowledge and free from desire, and ensures that the clever never dare to act. Do that which consists in taking no action, and order will prevail.",
    "The way is empty, yet use will not drain it. Deep, it is like the ancestor of the myriad creatures. Blunt the sharpness; Untangle the knots; Soften the glare; Let your wheels move only along old ruts. Darkly visible, it only seems as if it were there. I know not whose son it is. It images the forefather of God.",
    "Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs; the sage is ruthless, and treats the people as straw dogs. Is not the space between heaven and earth like a bellows? It is empty without being exhausted: The more it works the more comes out. Much speech leads inevitably to silence. Better to hold fast to the void.",
    "The spirit of the valley never dies. This is called the mysterious female. The gateway of the mysterious female Is called the root of heaven and earth. Dimly visible, it seems as if it were there, Yet use will never drain it.",
    "Heaven and earth are enduring. The reason why heaven and earth can be enduring is that they do not give themselves life. Hence they are able to be long-lived. Therefore the sage puts his person last and it comes first, Treats it as extraneous to himself and it is preserved. Is it not because he is without thought of self that he is able to accomplish his private ends?",
    "Highest good is like water. Because water excels in benefiting the myriad creatures without contending with them and settles where none would like to be, it comes close to the way. In a home it is the site that matters; In quality of mind it is depth that matters; In an ally it is benevolence that matters; In speech it is good faith that matters; In government it is order that matters; In affairs it is ability that matters; In action it is timeliness that matters. It is because it does not contend that it is never at fault.",
    "Rather than fill it to the brim by keeping it upright Better to have stopped in time; Hammer it to a point And the sharpness cannot be preserved for ever; There may be gold and jade to fill a hall But there is none who can keep them. To be overbearing when one has wealth and position Is to bring calamity upon oneself. To retire when the task is accomplished Is the way of heaven.",
    "When carrying on your head your perplexed bodily soul Can you embrace in your arms the One and not let go? In concentrating your breath can you become as supple As a babe? Can you polish your mysterious mirror And leave no blemish? Can you love the people and govern the state Without resorting to action? When the gates of heaven open and shut Are you capable of keeping to the role of the female? When your discernment penetrates the four quarters Are you capable of not knowing anything? It gives them life and rears them. It gives them life yet claims no possession; It benefits them yet exacts no gratitude; It is the steward yet exercises no authority. Such is called the mysterious virtue.",
    "Thirty spokes share one hub. Adapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the cart. Knead clay in order to make a vessel. Adapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the vessel. Cut out doors and windows in order to make a room. Adapt the nothing therein to the purpose in hand, and you will have the use of the room. Thus what we gain is Something, yet it is by virtue of Nothing that this can be put to use.",
    "The five colors make man's eyes blind; The five notes make his ears deaf; The five tastes injure his palate; Riding and hunting Make his mind go wild with excitement; Goods hard to come by Serve to hinder his progress. Hence the sage is For the belly Not for the eye. Therefore he discards the one and takes the other.",
    "Favor and disgrace are things that startle; High rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble. What is meant by saying favor and disgrace are things that startle? Favor when it is bestowed on a subject serves to startle as much as when it is withdrawn. This is what is meant by saying that favor and disgrace are things that startle. What is meant by saying that high rank is, like one's body, a source of great trouble? The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body. When I no longer have a body, what trouble have I? Hence he who values his body more than dominion over the empire can be entrusted with the empire. He who loves his body more than dominion over the empire can be given the custody of the empire.",
    "What cannot be seen is called evanescent; What cannot be heard is called rarefied; What cannot be touched is called minute. These three cannot be fathomed And so they are confused and looked upon as one. Its upper part is not dazzling; Its lower part is not obscure. Dimly visible, it cannot be named And returns to that which is without substance. This is called the shape that has no shape, The image that is without substance. This is called indistinct and shadowy. Go up to it and you will not see its head; Follow behind it and you will not see its rear. Hold fast to the way of antiquity In order to keep in control the realm of today. The ability to know the beginning of antiquity Is called the thread running through the way.",
    "Of old he who was well versed in the way Was minutely subtle, mysteriously comprehending, And too profound to be known. It is because he could not be known That he can only be given a makeshift description: Tentative, as if fording a river in winter, Hesitant, as if in fear of his neighbors; Formal like a guest; Falling apart like the thawing ice; Thick like the uncarved block; Vacant like a valley; Murky like muddy water. Who can be muddy and yet, settling, slowly become limpid? Who can be at rest and yet, stirring, slowly come to life? He who holds fast to this way Desires not to be full. It is because he is not full That he can be worn and yet newly made.",
    "I do my utmost to attain emptiness; I hold firmly to stillness. The myriad creatures all rise together And I watch their return. The teaming creatures All return to their separate roots. Returning to one's roots is known as stillness. This is what is meant by returning to one's destiny. Returning to one's destiny is known as the constant. Knowledge of the constant is known as discernment. Woe to him who wilfully innovates While ignorant of the constant, But should one act from knowledge of the constant One's action will lead to impartiality, Impartiality to kingliness, Kingliness to heaven, Heaven to the way, The way to perpetuity, And to the end of one's days one will meet with no danger.",
    "The best of all rulers is but a shadowy presence to his subjects. Next comes the ruler they love and praise; Next comes one they fear; Next comes one with whom they take liberties. When there is not enough faith, there is lack of good faith. Hesitant, he does not utter words lightly. When his task is accomplished and his work done The people all say, 'It happened to us naturally.'",
    "When the great way falls into disuse There are benevolence and rectitude; When cleverness emerges There is great hypocrisy; When the six relations are at variance There are filial children; When the state is benighted There are loyal ministers.",
    "Exterminate learning and there will no longer be worries. Exterminate the sage, discard the wise, And the people will benefit a hundredfold; Exterminate benevolence, discard rectitude, And the people will again be filial; Exterminate ingenuity, discard profit, And there will be no more thieves and bandits. These three, being false adornments, are not enough And the people must have something to which they can attach themselves: Exhibit the unadorned and embrace the uncarved block, Have little thought of self and as few desires as possible.",
    "Between yea and nay How much difference is there? Between good and evil How great is the distance? What others fear One must also fear. The multitude are joyous As if partaking of the offering Or going up to a terrace in spring. I alone am inactive and reveal no signs, And wax without having reached the limit. Like a baby that has not yet learned to smile, Listless as though with no home to go back to. The multitude all have more than enough. I alone seem to be in want. My mind is that of a fool - how blank! Vulgar people are clear. I alone am drowsy. Vulgar people are alert. I alone am muddled. Calm like the sea; Like a high wind that never ceases. The multitude all have a purpose. I alone am foolish and uncouth. I alone am different from others And value being fed by the mother.",
    "In his every movement a man of great virtue Follows the way and the way only. As a thing the way is Shadowy and indistinct. Indistinct and shadowy, Yet within it is an image; Shadowy and indistinct, Yet within it is a substance. Dim and dark, Yet within it is an essence. This essence is quite genuine And within it is something that can be tested. From the present back to antiquity, Its name never deserted it. It serves as a means for inspecting the fathers of the multitude. How do I know that the fathers of the multitude are like that? By means of this.",
    "Bowed down then preserved; Bent then straight; Hollow then full; Worn then new; A little then benefited; A lot then perplexed. Therefore the sage embraces the One and is a model for the empire. He does not show himself, and so is conspicuous; He does not consider himself right, and so is illustrious; He does not brag, and so has merit; He does not boast, and so endures. It is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him. The way the ancients had it, 'Bowed down then preserved', is no empty saying. Truly it enables one to be preserved to the end.",
    "To use words but rarely Is to be natural. Hence a gusty wind cannot last all morning, and a sudden downpour cannot last all day. Who is it that produces these? Heaven and earth. If even heaven and earth cannot go on forever, much less can man. That is why one follows the way. A man of the way conforms to the way; A man of virtue conforms to virtue; A man of loss conforms to loss. He who conforms to the way is gladly accepted by the way; He who conforms to virtue is gladly accepted by virtue; He who conforms to loss is gladly accepted by loss. When there is not enough faith, there is lack of good faith.",
    "He who tiptoes cannot stand; he who strides cannot walk. He who shows himself is not conspicuous; He who considers himself right is not illustrious; He who brags will have no merit; He who boasts will not endure. From the point of view of the way these are 'excessive food and useless excresences'. As there are Things that detest them, he who has the way does not abide in them.",
    "There is a thing confusedly formed, Born before heaven and earth. Silent and void It stands alone and does not change, Goes round and does not weary. It is capable of being the mother of the world. I know not its name So I style it 'the way'. I give it the makeshift name of 'the great'. Being great, it is further described as receding, Receding, it is described as far away, Being far away, it is described as turning back. Hence the way is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; The king is also great. Within the realm there are four things that are great, And the king counts as one. Man models himself on earth, Earth on heaven, Heaven on the way, And the way on that which is naturally so.",
    "The heavy is the root of the light; The still is the lord of the restless. Therefore the gentleman when travelling all day Never lets the heavily laden carts out of his sight. It is only when he is safely behind walls and watch-towers That he rests peacefully and is above worries. How, then, should a ruler of ten thousand chariots Make light of his own person in the eyes of the empire? If light, then the root is lost; If restless, then the lord is lost.",
    "One who excels in travelling leaves no wheel tracks; One who excels in speech makes no slips; One who excels in reckoning uses no counting rods; One who excels in shutting uses no bolts yet what he has shut cannot be opened. One who excels in tying uses no cords yet what he has tied cannot be undone. Therefore the sage always excels in saving people, and so abandons no one; Always excels in saving things, and so abandons nothing. This is called following one's discernment. Hence the good man is the teacher the bad learns from; And the bad man is the material the good works on. Not to value the teacher Nor to love the material Though it seems clever, betrays great bewilderment. This is called the essential and the secret.",
    "Know the male But keep to the role of the female And be a ravine to the empire. If you are a ravine to the empire, Then the constant virtue will not desert you And you will again return to being a babe. Know the white But keep to the role of the sullied And be a model to the empire. If you are a model to the empire, Then the constant virtue will not be wanting And you will return to the infinite, Know honour But keep to the role of the disgraced And be a valley to the empire. If you are a valley to the empire, Then the constant virtue will be sufficient And you will return to being the uncarved block. When the uncarved block shatters it becomes vessels. The sage makes use of these and becomes the lord over the officials. Hence the greatest cutting does not sever.",
    "Whoever takes the empire and wishes to do anything to it I see will have no respite. The empire is a sacred vessel and nothing should be done to it. Whoever does anything to it will ruin it; whoever lays hold of it will lose it. Hence some things lead and some follow; Some breathe gently and some breathe hard; Some are strong and some are weak; Some destroy and some are destroyed. Therefore the sage avoids excess, extravagance, and arrogance.",
    "One who assists the ruler of men by means of the way does not intimidate the empire by a show of arms. This is something which is liable to rebound. Where troops have encamped There will brambles grow; In the wake of a mighty army Bad harvests follow without fail. One who is good aims only at bringing his campaign to a conclusion and dare not thereby intimidate. Bring it to a conclusion but do not brag; Bring it to a conclusion but do not be arrogant; Bring it to a conclusion but only when there is no choice; Bring it to a conclusion but do not intimidate. A creature in its prime doing harm to the old Is known as going against the way. That which goes against the way will come to an early end.",
    "It is because arms are instruments of ill omen and there are Things that detest them that the one who has the way does not abide by their use. The gentleman gives precedence to the left when at home, but to the right when he goes to war. Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the instruments of the gentleman. When one is compelled to use them, it is best to do so without relish. There is no glory in victory, and so to glorify it despite this is to exult in the killing of men. One who exults in the killing of men will never have his way in the empire. On occasions of rejoicing precedence is given to the left; On occasions of mourning precedence is given to the right. A lieutenants place is on the left; The general's place is on the right. This means that it is mourning rites that are observed. When great numbers of people are killed, one should weep over them with sorrow. When victorious in war, one should observe the rites of mourning.",
    "The way is for ever nameless. Though the uncarved block is small No one in the world dare claim its allegiance. Should lords and princes be able to hold fast to it The myriad creatures will submit of their own accord, Heaven and earth will unite and sweet dew will fall, And the people will be equitable, though no one so decrees. Only when it is cut are there names. As soon as there are names One ought to know that it is time to stop. Knowing when to stop one can be free from danger. The way is to the world as the River and the Sea are to rivulets and streams.",
    "He who knows others is clever; He who knows himself has discernment. He who overcomes others has force; He who overcomes himself is strong. He who knows contentment is rich; He who perseveres is a man of purpose; He who does not lose his station will endure; He who lives out his days has had a long life.",
    "The way is broad, reaching left as well as right. The myriad creatures depend on it for life yet it claims no authority. It accomplishes its task yet lays claim to no merit. It clothes and feeds the myriad creatures yet lays no claim to being their master. For ever free of desire, it can be called small; Yet as it lays no claim to being master when the myriad creatures turn to it, it can be called great. It is because it never attempts itself to become great that it succeeds in becoming great.",
    "Have in your hold the great image And the empire will come to you. Coming to you and meeting with no harm It will be safe and sound. Music and food Will induce the wayfarer to stop. The way in its passage through the mouth is without flavor. It cannot be seen, It cannot be heard, Yet it cannot be exhausted by use.",
    "If you would have a thing shrink, You must first stretch it; If you would have a thing weakened, You must first strengthen it; If you would have a thing laid aside, You must first set it up; If you would take from a thing, You must first give to it. This is called subtle discernment: The submissive and weak will overcome the hard and strong. The fish must not be allowed to leave the deep; The instruments of power in a state must not be revealed to anyone.",
    "The way never acts, yet nothing is left undone. Should lords and princes be able to hold fast to it, The myriad creatures will be transformed of their own accord. After they are transformed, should desire raise its head, I shall press it down with the weight of the nameless uncarved block. The nameless uncarved block Is but freedom from desire, And if I cease to desire and remain still, The empire will be at peace of its own accord.",
    "A man of the highest virtue does not keep to virtue and that is why he has virtue. A man of the lowest virtue never strays from virtue and that is why he is without virtue. The former never acts yet leaves nothing undone. The latter acts but there are things left undone. A man of the highest benevolence acts, but from no ulterior motive. A man of the highest rectitude acts, but from ulterior motive. A man most conversant in the rites acts, but when no one responds rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force. Hence when the way was lost there was virtue; When virtue was lost there was benevolence; When benevolence was lost there was rectitude; When rectitude was lost there were the rites. The rites are the wearing thin of loyalty and good faith And the beginning of disorder; Foreknowledge is the flowery embellishment of the way And the beginning of folly. Hence the man of large mind abides in the thick not in the thin, in the fruit not in the flower. Therefore he discards the one and takes the other.",
    "Of old, these came to be in possession of the One: Heaven in virtue of the One is limpid; Earth in virtue of the One is settled; Gods in virtue of the One have their potencies; The valley in virtue of the One is full; The myriad creatures in virtue of the One are alive; Lords and princes in virtue of the One become leaders of the empire. It is the One that makes these what they are. Without what makes it limpid heaven might split; Without what makes it settled earth might sink; Without what gives them their potencies gods might spend themselves; Without what makes it full the valley might run dry; Without what keeps them alive the myriad creatures might perish; Without what makes them leaders lords and princes might fall. Hence the superior must have the inferior as root; The high must have the low as base. Thus lords and princes refer to themselves as 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless'. This is taking the inferior as root, is it not? Hence the highest renown is without renown, Not wishing to be one among many like jade Nor to be aloof like stone.",
    "Turning back is how the way moves; Weakness is the means the way employs. The myriad creatures in the world are born from Something, and Something from Nothing.",
    "When the best student hears about the way He practises it assiduously; When the average student hears about the way It seems to him there one moment and gone the next; When the worst student hears about the way He laughs out loud. If he did not laugh It would be unworthy of being the way. Hence the Chien yen has it: The way that is bright seems dull; The way that is forward seems to lead backward; The way that is even seems rough. The highest virtue is like the valley; The sheerest whiteness seems sullied; Ample virtue seems defective; Vigorous virtue seems indolent; Plain virtue seems soiled; The great square has no corners. The great vessel takes long to complete; The great note is rarefied in sound; The great image has no shape. The way conceals itself in being nameless. It is the way alone that excels in bestowing and in accomplishing.",
    "The way begets one; One begets two; Two begets three; Three begets the myriad creatures. The myriad creatures carry on their backs the yin and embrace in their arms the yang and are the blending of the generative forces of the two. There are no words which men detest more than 'solitary', 'desolate', and 'hapless', yet lords and princes use these to refer to themselves. Thus a thing is sometimes added to by being diminished and diminished by being added to. What others teach I also teach. 'The violent shall not come to a natural end.' I shall take this as my precept.",
    "Exterminate learning, and there will no longer be worries. The most submissive thing in the world can ride roughshod over the hardest in the world; That which is without substance entering that which has no crevices. That is why I know the benefit of resorting to no action. The teaching that uses no words, the benefit of resorting to no action, these are beyond the understanding of all but a very few in the world.",
    "Your name or your person, Which is dearer? Your person or your goods, Which is worth more? Gain or loss, Which is a greater bane? That is why excessive meanness Is sure to lead to great expense; Too much store Is sure to end in immense loss. Know contentment And you will suffer no disgrace; Know when to stop And you will meet with no danger. You can then endure.",
    "Great perfection seems chipped, Yet use will not wear it out; Great fullness seems empty, Yet use will not drain it; Great straightness seems bent; Great skill seems awkward; Great eloquence seems tongue-tied. Restlessness overcomes cold; Stillness overcomes heat. Limpid and still, One can be a leader in the empire.",
    "When the way prevails in the empire, fleet-footed horses are relegated to ploughing in the fields; When the way does not prevail in the empire, war-horses breed on the border. There is no crime greater than having too many desires; There is no disaster greater than not being content; There is no misfortune greater than being covetous. Hence in being content, one will always have enough.",
    "Without stirring abroad One can know the whole world; Without looking out the window One can see the way of heaven. The further one goes The less one knows. Therefore the sage knows without having to stir, Identifies without having to see, Accomplishes without having to act.",
    "In the pursuit of learning one knows more every day; In the pursuit of the way one does less every day. One does less and less until one does nothing at all, and when one does nothing at all there is nothing that is undone. It is always through not meddling that the empire is won. Should you meddle, then you are not equal to the task of winning the empire.",
    "The sage has no mind of his own. He takes as his own the mind of the people. Those who are good I treat as good. Those who are not good I also treat as good. In so doing I gain in goodness. Those who are of good faith I have faith in. Those who are lacking in good faith I also have faith in. In so doing I gain in good faith. The sage in his attempt to distract the mind of the empire seeks urgently to muddle it. The people all have something to occupy their eyes and ears, and the sage treats them all like children.",
    "When going one way means life and going the other means death, three in ten will be comrades in life, three in ten will be comrades in death, and there are those who value life and as a result move into the realm of death, and these also number three in ten. Why is this so? Because they set too much store by life. I have heard it said that one who excels in safeguarding his own life does not meet with rhinoceros or tiger when travelling on land nor is he touched by weapons when charging into an army. There is nowhere for the rhinoceros to pitch its horn; There is nowhere for the tiger to place its claws; There is nowhere for the weapon to lodge its blade. Why is this so? Because for him there is no realm of death.",
    "The way gives them life; Virtue rears them; Things give them shape; Circumstances bring them to maturity. Therefore the myriad creatures all revere the way and honor virtue. Yet the way is revered and virtue honored not because this is decreed by any authority but because it is natural for them to be treated so. Thus the way gives them life and rears them; Brings them up and nurses them; Brings them to fruition and maturity; Feeds and shelters them. It gives them life yet claims no possession; It benefits them yet exacts no gratitude; It is the steward yet exercises no authority. Such is called the mysterious virtue.",
    "The world had a beginning And this beginning could be the mother of the world. When you know the mother Go on to know the child. After you have known the child Go back to holding fast to the mother, And to the end of your days you will not meet with danger. Block the openings, Shut the doors, And all your life you will not run dry. Unblock the openings, Add to your troubles, And to the end of your days you will be beyond salvation. To see the small is called discernment; To hold fast to the submissive is called strength. Use the light But give up the discernment. Bring not misfortune upon yourself. This is known as following the constant.",
    "Were I possessed of the least knowledge, I would, when walking on the great way, fear only paths that lead astray. The great way is easy, yet people prefer by-paths. The court is corrupt, The fields are overgrown with weeds, The granaries are empty; Yet there are those dressed in fineries, With swords at their sides, Filled with food and drink, And possessed of too much wealth. This is known as taking the lead in robbery. Far indeed is this from the way.",
    "What is firmly rooted cannot be pulled out; What is tightly held in the arms will not slip loose; Through this the offering of sacrifice by descendants will never come to an end. Cultivate it in your person And its virtue will be genuine; Cultivate it in the family And its virtue will be more than sufficient; Cultivate it in the hamlet And its virtue will endure; Cultivate it in the state And its virtue will abound; Cultivate it in the empire And its virtue will be pervasive. Hence look at the person through the person; Look at the family through the family; Look at the hamlet through the hamlet; Look at the state through the state; Look at the empire through the empire. How do I know that the empire is like that? By means of this.",
    "One who possesses virtue in abundance is comparable to a new born babe: Poisonous insects will not sting it; Ferocious animals will not pounce on it; Predatory birds will not swoop down on it. Its bones are weak and its sinews supple yet its hold is firm. It does not know the union of male and female yet its male member will stir: This is because its virility is at its height. It howls all day yet does not become hoarse: This is because its harmony is at its height. To know harmony is called the constant; To know the constant is called discernment. To try to add to one's vitality is called ill-omened; For the mind to egg on the breath is called violent. A creature in its prime doing harm to the old Is known as going against the way. That which goes against the way will come to an early end.",
    "One who knows does not speak; One who speaks does not know. Block the openings; Shut the doors. Blunt the sharpness; Untangle the knots; Soften the glare; Let your wheels move only along old ruts. This is known as mysterious sameness. Hence you cannot get close to it, nor can you keep it at arm's length; You cannot bestow benefit on it, nor can you do it harm; You cannot ennoble it, nor can you debase it. Therefore it is valued by the empire.",
    "Govern the state by being straightforward; Wage war by being crafty; But win the empire by not being meddlesome. How do I know that it is like that? By means of this. The more taboos there are in the empire The poorer the people; The more sharpened tools the people have The more benighted the state; The more skills the people have The further novelties multiply; The better known the laws and edicts The more thieves and robbers there are. Hence the sage says, I take no action and the people are transformed of themselves; I prefer stillness and the people are rectified of themselves; I am not meddlesome and the people prosper of themselves; I am free from desire and the people of themselves become simple like the uncarved block.",
    "When the government is muddled The people are simple; When the government is alert The people are cunning. It is on disaster that good fortune perches; It is beneath good fortune that disaster crouches. Who knows the limit? Does not the straightforward exist? The straighforward changes again into the crafty, and the good changes again into the monstrous. Indeed, it is long since the people were perplexed. Therefore the sage is square-edged but does not scrape, Has corners but does not jab, Extends himself but not at the expense of others, Shines but does not dazzle.",
    "In ruling the people and in serving heaven it is best for a ruler to be sparing. It is because he is sparing That he may be said to follow the way from the start; Following the way from the start he may be said to accumulate an abundance of virtue; Accumulating an abundance of virtue there is nothing he cannot overcome; When there is nothing he cannot overcome, no one knows his limit; When no one knows his limit He can possess a state; When he possesses the mother of a state He can then endure. This is called the way of deep roots and firm stems by which one lives to see many days.",
    "Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish. When the empire is ruled in accordance with the way, The spirits lose their potencies. Or rather, it is not that they lose their potencies, But that, though they have their potencies, they do not harm the people. It is not only they who, having their potencies, do not harm the people, The sage, also, does not harm the people. As neither does any harm, each attributes the merit to the other.",
    "A large state is the lower reaches of a river: The place where all the streams of the world unite. In the union of the world, The female always gets the better of the male by stillness. Being still, she takes the lower position. Hence the large state, by taking the lower position, annexes the small state; The small state, by taking the lower position, affiliates itself to the large state. Thus the one, by taking the lower position, annexes; The other, by taking the lower position, is annexed. All that the large state wants is to take the other under its wing; All that the small state wants is to have its services accepted by the other. If each of the two wants to find its proper place, It is meet that the large should take the lower position.",
    "The way is the refuge for the myriad creatures. It is that by which the good man protects, And that by which the bad is protected. Beautiful words when offered will win high rank in return; Beautiful deeds can raise a man above others. Even if a man is not good, why should he be abandoned? Hence when the emperor is set up and the three ducal ministers are appointed, he who makes a present of the way without stirring from his seat is preferable to one who offers presents of jade disks followed by a team of four horses. Why was this way valued of old? Was it not said that by means of it one got what one wanted and escaped the consequences when one transgressed? Therefore it is valued by the empire.",
    "Do that which consists in taking no action; Pursue that which is not meddlesome; Savor that which has no flavor. Make the small big and the few many; Do good to him who has done you an injury. Lay plans for the accomplishment of the difficult before it becomes difficult; Make something big by starting with it when small. Difficult things in the word must needs have their beginnings in the easy; Big things must needs have their beginnings in the small. Therefore it is because the sage never attempts to be great that he succeeds in becoming great. One who makes promises rashly rarely keeps good faith; One who is in the habit of considering things easy meets with frequent difficulties. Therefore even the sage treats some things as difficult. That is why in the end no difficulties can get the better of him.",
    "It is easy to maintain a situation while it is still secure; It is easy to deal with a situation before symptoms develop; It is easy to break a thing when it is yet brittle; It is easy to dissolve a thing when it is yet minute. Deal with a thing while it is still nothing; Keep a thing in order before disorder sets in. A tree that can fill the span of a man's arms Grows from a downy tip; A terrace nine storeys high Rises from hodfuls of earth; A journey of a thousand miles Starts from beneath one's feet. Whoever does anything to it will ruin it; Whoever lays hold of it will lose it. Therefore the sage, because he does nothing, never ruins anything; And, because he does not lay hold of anything, loses nothing. In their enterprises the people Always ruin them when on the verge of success. Be as careful at the end as at the beginning And there will be no ruined enterprises. Therefore the sage desires not to desire And does not value goods which are hard to come by; Learns to be without learning And makes good the mistakes of the multitude In order to help the myriad creatures to be natural and to refrain from daring to act.",
    "Of old those who excelled in the pursuit of the way did not use it to enlighten the people but to hoodwink them. The reason why the people are difficult to govern is that they are too clever. Hence to rule a state by cleverness Will be to the detriment of the state; Not to rule a state by cleverness Will be a boon to the state. These two are models. Always to know the models Is known as mysterious virtue. Mysterious virtue is profound and far-reaching, But when things turn back it turns back with them. Only then is complete conformity realized.",
    "The reason why the River and the Sea are able to be king of the hundred valleys is that they excel in taking the lower position. Hence they are able to be king of the hundred valleys. Therefore, desiring to rule over the people, One must in one's words humble oneself before them; And, desiring to lead the people, One must, in one's person, follow behind them. Therefore the sage takes his place over the people yet is no burden; takes his place ahead of the people yet causes no obstruction. That is why the empire supports him joyfully and never tires of doing so. It is because he does not contend that no one in the empire is in a position to contend with him.",
    "The whole world says that my way is vast and resembles nothing. It is because it is vast that it resembles nothing. If it resembled anything, it would, long before now, have become small. I have three treasures Which I hold and cherish. The first is known as compassion, The second is known as frugality, The third is known as not daring to take the lead in the empire; Being compassionate one could afford to be courageous, Being frugal one could afford to extend one's territory, Not daring to take the lead in the empire one could afford to be lord over the vessels. Now, to forsake compassion for courage, to forsake frugality for expansion, to forsake the rear for the lead, is sure to end in death. Through compassion, one will triumph in attack and be impregnable in defence. What heaven succours it protects with the gift of compassion.",
    "One who excels as a warrior does not appear formidable; One who excels in fighting is never roused in anger; One who excels in defeating his enemy does not join issue; One who excels in employing others humbles himself before them. This is known as the virtue of non-contention; This is known as making use of the efforts of others; This is known as matching the sublimity of heaven.",
    "The strategists have a saying, I dare not play the host but play the guest, I dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot instead. This is known as marching forward when there is no road, Rolling up one's sleeves when there is no arm, Dragging one's adversary by force when there is no adversary, And taking up arms when there are no arms. There is no disaster greater than taking on an enemy too easily. So doing nearly cost me my treasure. Thus of two sides raising arms against each other, It is the one that is sorrow-stricken that wins.",
    "My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice, Yet no one in the world can understand them or put them into practice. Words have an ancestor and affairs have a sovereign. It is because people are ignorant that they fail to understand me. Those who understand me are few; Those who harm me are honoured. Therefore the sage, while clad in homespun, conceals on his person a priceless piece of jade.",
    "To know yet to think that one does not know is best; Not to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty. It is by being alive to difficulty that one can avoid it. The sage meets with no difficulty. It is because he is alive to it that he meets with no difficulty.",
    "When the people lack a proper sense of awe, then some awful visitation will descend upon them. Do not constrict their living space; Do not press down on their means of livelihood. It is because you do not press down on them that they will not weary of the burden. Hence the sage knows himself but does not display himself, Loves himself but does not exalt himself. Therefore he discards the one and takes the other.",
    "He who is fearless in being bold will meet with his death; He who is fearless in being timid will stay alive. Of the two, one leads to good, the other to harm. Heaven hates what it hates, Who knows the reason why? Therefore even the sage treats some things as difficult. The way of heaven Excels in overcoming though it does not contend, In responding though it does not speak, In attracting though it does not summon, In laying plans though it appears slack. The net of heaven is cast wide. Though the mesh is not fine, yet nothing ever slips through.",
    "When the people are not afraid of death, wherefore frighten them with death? Were the people always afraid of death, and were I able to arrest and put to death those who innovate, then who would dare? There is a regular executioner whose charge it is to kill. To kill on behalf of the executioner is what is described as chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter. In chopping wood on behalf of the master carpenter, there are few who escape hurting their own hands instead.",
    "The people are hungry: It is because those in authority eat up too much in taxes That the people are hungry. The people are difficult to govern. It is because those in authority are too fond of action That the people are difficult to govern. The people treat death lightly: It is because the people set too much store by life That they treat death lightly. It is just because one has no use for life that one is wiser than the man who values life.",
    "A man is supple and weak when living, but hard and stiff when dead. Grass and trees are pliant and fragile when living, but dried and shrivelled when dead. Thus the hard and the strong are the comrades of death; The supple and the weak are the comrades of life. Therefore a weapon that is strong will not vanquish; A tree that is strong will suffer the axe. The strong and big takes the lower position, The supple and weak takes the higher position.",
    "Is not the way of heaven like the stretching of a bow? The high it presses down, The low it lifts up; The excessive it takes from, The deficient it gives to. It is the way of heaven to take from what has in excess in order to make good what is deficient. The way of man is otherwise: it takes from those who are in want in order to offer this to those who already have more than enough. Who is there that can take what he himself has in excess and offer this to the empire? Only he who has the way. Therefore the sage benefits them yet exacts no gratitude, Accomplishes his task yet lays claim to no merit. Is this not because he does not wish to be considered a better man than others?",
    "In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water. Yet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it. This is because there is nothing that can take its place. That the weak overcomes the strong, And the submissive overcomes the hard, Everyone in the world knows yet no one can put this knowledge into practice. Therefore the sage says, One who takes on himself the humiliation of the state Is called a ruler worthy of offering sacrifices to the gods of earth and millet. One who takes on himself the calamity of the state Is called a king worthy of dominion over the entire empire. Straightforward words seem paradoxical.",
    "When peace is made between great enemies, Some enmity is bound to remain undispelled. How can this be considered perfect? Therefore the sage takes the left-hand tally, but exacts no payment from the people. The man of virtue takes charge of the tally; The man of no virtue takes charge of exaction. It is the way of heaven to show no favoritism. It is for ever on the side of the good man.",
    "Reduce the size of the population and the state. Ensure that even though the people have tools of war for a troop or a battalion they will not use them; And also that they will be reluctant to move to distant places because they look on death as no light matter. Even when they have ships and carts, they will have no use for them; And even when they have armor and weapons, they will have no occasion to make a show of them. Bring it about that the people will return to the use of the knotted rope, Will find relish in their food And beauty in their clothes, Will be content in their abode And happy in the way they live. Though adjoining states are within sight of one another, And the sound of dogs barking and cocks crowing in one state can be heard in another, yet the people of one state will grow old and die without having had any dealings with those of another.",
    "Truthful words are not beautiful; Beautiful words are not truthful. Good words are not persuasive; Persuasive words are not good. He who knows has no wide learning; He who has wide learning does not know. The sage does not hoard. Having bestowed all he has on others, he has yet more; Having given all he has to others, he is richer still. The way of heaven benefits and does not harm; The way of the sage is bountiful and does not contend.",

    "The Tao the can be told of Is not the Absolute Tao; The Names that can be given Are not Absolute Names. The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; The Named is the Mother of All Things. Therefore: Oftentimes, one strips oneself of passion In order to see the Secret of Life; Oftentimes, one regards life with passion, In order to see its manifest forms. These two (the Secret and its manifestations) Are (in their nature) the same; They are given different names When they become manifest. They may both be called the Cosmic Mystery: Reaching from the Mystery into the Deeper Mystery Is the Gate to the Secret of All Life.",

Therefore the Sage: Manages affairs without action; Preaches the doctrine without words; All things take their rise, but he does not turn away from them; He gives them life, but does not take possession of them; He acts, but does not appropriate; Accomplishes, but claims no credit.

Being great implies reaching out in space, Reaching out in space implies far-reaching, Far-reaching implies reversion to the original point.

He who delights in slaughter Will not succeed in his ambition to rule the world. The things of good omen favor the left. The things of ill omen favor the right.

The man of superior character never acts, Nor ever (does so) with an ulterior motive. The man of inferior character acts, And (does so) with an ulterior motive. The man of superior kindness acts, But (does so) without an ulterior motive. The man of superior justice acts, And (does so) with an ulterior motive. (But when) the man of superior li acts and finds no response, He rolls up his sleeves to force it on others. Therefore: After Tao is lost, then (arises the doctrine of) humanity. After humanity is lost, then (arises the doctrine of) justice. After justice is lost, then (arises the doctrine of) li. Now li is the thinning out of loyalty and honesty of heart. And the beginning of chaos. The prophets are the flowering of Tao And the origin of folly. Therefore the noble man dwells in the heavy (base), And not in the thinning (end). He dwells in the fruit, And not in the flowering (expression). Therefore he rejects the one and accepts the other.",
    "There were those in ancient times possessed of the One; Through possession of the One, the Heaven was clarified, Through possession of the One, The Earth was stabilized, Through possession of the One, the gods were spiritualized, Through possession of the One, the valleys were made full, Through possession of the One, all things lived and grew, Through possession of the One, the princes and dukes became the ennobled of the people. - that was how each became so. Without clarity, the Heavens would shake, Without stability, the Earth would quake, Without spiritual power, the gods would crumble, Without being filled, the valleys would crack, Without the life-giving power, all things would perish, Without the ennobling power, the princes and dukes would stumble. Therefore the nobility depend upon the common man for support, And the exalted ones depend upon the lowly for their base. That is why the princes and dukes call themselves 'the orphaned,' 'the lonely one,' 'the unworthy.' Is is not true then that they depend upon the common man for support? Truly, take down the parts of a chariot, And there is no chariot (left). Rather than jingle like the jade, Rumble like the rocks.",
    "Reversion is the action of Tao. Gentleness is the function of Tao. The things of this world come from Being, And Being (comes) from Non-being.",
    "When the highest type of men hear the Tao (truth), they try hard to live in accordance with it. When the mediocre type hear the Tao, they seem to be aware and yet unaware of it. When the lowest type hear the Tao, They break into loud laughter - If it were not laughed at, it would not be Tao. Therefore there is the established saying: 'Who understands Tao seems dull of comprehension; Who is advance in Tao seems to slip backwards; Who moves on the even Tao (Path) seems to go up and down.' Superior character appears like a hollow (valley); Sheer white appears like tarnished; Great character appears like infirm; Pure worth appears like contaminated. Great space has no corners; Great talent takes long to mature; Great music is faintly heard; Great form has no contour; And Tao is hidden without a name. It is this Tao that is adept at lending (its power) and bringing fulfillment.",
    "Out of Tao, One is born; Out of One, Two; Out of Two, Three; Out of Three, the created universe. The created universe carries the yin at its back and the yang in front; Through the union of the pervading principles it reaches harmony. To be 'orphaned,' 'lonely' and 'unworthy' is what men hate most. Yet the princes and dukes call themselves by such names. For sometimes things are benefited by being taken away from, And suffer by being added to. Others have taught this maxim, Which I shall teach also: 'The violent man shall die a violent death.' This I shall regard as my spiritual teacher.",
    "The softest substance of the world Goes through the hardest. That-which-is-without-form penetrates that-which-has-no-crevice; Through this I know the benefit of taking no action. The teaching without words And the benefit of taking no action Are without compare in the universe.",
    "Fame or one's own self, which does one love more? One's own self or material goods, which has more worth? Loss (of self) or possession (of goods), which is the greater evil? Therefore: he who loves most spends most, He who hoards much loses much. The contented man meets no disgrace; Who know when to stop runs into no danger - He can long endure.",
    "The highest perfection is like imperfection, And its use is never impaired. The greatest abundance seems meager, And its use will never fail. What is most straight appears devious, The greatest skill appears clumsiness; The greatest eloquence seems like stuttering. Movement overcomes cold, (But) keeping still overcomes heat. Who is calm and quiet becomes the guide for the universe.",
    "When the world lives in accord with Tao, Racing horses are turned back to haul refuse carts. When the world lives not in accord with Tao, Cavalry abounds in the countryside. There is no greater curse than the lack of contentment. No greater sin than the desire for possession. Therefore he who is contented with contentment shall be always content.",
    "Without stepping outside one's doors, One can know what is happening in the world, Without looking out of one's windows, One can see the Tao of heaven. The farther one pursues knowledge, The less one knows. Therefore the Sage knows without running about, Understands without seeing, Accomplishes without doing.",
    "The student of knowledge (aims at) learning day by day; The student of Tao (aims at) losing day by day. By continual losing One reaches doing nothing (laissez-faire). He who conquers the world often does so by doing nothing. When one is compelled to do something, The world is already beyond his conquering.",
    "The Sage has no decided opinions and feelings, But regards the people's opinions and feelings as his own. The good ones I declare good; The bad ones I also declare good. That is the goodness of Virtue. The honest ones I believe; The liars I also believe; That is the faith of Virtue. The Sage dwells in the world peacefully, harmoniously. The people of the world are brought into a community of heart, And the Sage regards them all as his own children.",
    "Out of life, death enters. The companions (organs) of life are thirteen; The companions (organs) of death are (also) thirteen. What send man to death in this life are also (these) thirteen. How is it so? Because of the intense activity of multiplying life. It has been said that the who is a good preserver of hi life Meets no tigers or wild buffaloes on land, Is not vulnerable to weapons in the field of battle. The horns of the wild buffalo are powerless against him. How is it so? Because he is beyond death.",
    "Tao gives them birth, Teh (character) fosters them. The material world gives them form. The circumstances of the moment complete them. Therefore all things of the universe worship Tao and exalt Teh. Tao is worshipped and Teh is exalted Without anyone's order but is so of its own accord. Therefore Tao gives them birth, Teh fosters them, Makes them grow, develops them, Gives them a harbor, a place to dwell in peace, Feeds them and shelter them. It gives them birth and does not own them, Acts (helps) and does not appropriate them, Is superior, and does not control them. - This is the Mystic Virtue.",
    "There was a beginning of the universe Which may be regarded as the Mother of the Universe. From the Mother, we may know her sons. After knowing the sons, keep to the Mother. Thus one's whole life may be preserved from harm. Stop its apertures, Close its doors, And one's whole life is without toil. Open its apertures, Be busy about its affairs, And one's whole life is beyond redemption. He who can see the small is clear-sighted; He who stays by gentility is strong. Use the light, And return to clear-sightedness - Thus cause not yourself later distress. - This is to rest in the Absolute.",
    "If I were possessed of Austere Knowledge, Walking on the Main Path (Tao), I would avoid the by-paths. The Main path is easy to walk on, Yet people love the small by-paths. The (official) courts are spic and span, (While) the fields go untilled, And the (people's) granaries are very low. (Yet) clad in embroidered gowns, And carrying find swords, Surfeited with good food and drinks, (They are) splitting with wealth and possessions. - This is to lead the world toward brigandage. Is this not corruption of Tao?",
    "Who is firmly established is not easily shaken. Who has a firm grasp does not easily let go. From generation to generation his ancestral sacrifices Shall be continued without fail. Cultivated in the individual, character will become genuine; Cultivated in the family, character will become abundant; Cultivated in the village, character will multiply; Cultivated in the state, character will prosper; Cultivated in the world, character will become universal. Therefore: According to (the character of ) the individual, judge the individual; According to (the character of ) the family, judge the family; According to (the character of ) the village, judge the village; According to (the character of ) the state, judge the state; According to (the character of ) the world, judge the world.

His bones are soft, his sinews tender, yet his grip is strong. Not knowing the union of male and female, yet his organs are complete, Which means his vigor is unspoiled. Crying the whole day, yet his voice never runs hoarse, Which means his (natural) harmony is perfect. To know harmony is to be in accord with the eternal, (And) to know eternity is called discerning. (But) to improve upon life is called an ill-omen; To let go the emotions through impulse is called assertiveness. (For) things age after reaching their prime; That (assertiveness) would be against Tao. And he who is against Tao perishes young.",
    "He who knows does not speak; He who speaks does not know. Fill up its apertures, Close its doors, Dull its edges, Untie its tangles, Soften its light, Submerge its turmoil, - This is the Mystic Unity. Then love and hatred cannot touch him. Profit and loss cannot reach him. Honor and disgrace cannot affect him. Therefore is he always the honored one of the world.",
    "Rule a kingdom by the Normal. Fight a battle by (abnormal) tactics of surprise. Win the world by doing nothing. How do I know it is so? Through this: - The more prohibitions there are, The poorer the people become. The more sharp weapons there are, The greater the chaos in the state. The more skills of technique, The more cunning things are produced. The greater the number of statutes, The greater the number of thieves and brigands. Therefore the sage says: I do nothing and the people are reformed of themselves. I love quietude and the people are righteous of themselves. I deal in no business and the people grow rich by themselves. I have no desires and the people are simple and honest by themselves.",
    "When the government is lazy and dull, Its people are unspoiled; When the government is efficient and smart, Its people are discontented. Disaster is the avenue of fortune, (And) fortune is the concealment for disaster. Who would be able to know its ultimate results? (As it is), there would never be the normal. But the normal would (immediately) revert to the deceitful. And the good revert to the sinister. Thus long has mankind gone astray! Therefore the Sage is square (has firm principles), but not cutting (sharp-cornered), Has integrity but does not hurt (others), Is straight, but not high-handed, Bright, but not dazzling.",
    "In managing human affairs, there is no better rule than to be sparing. To be sparing is to forestall; To forestall is to be prepared and strengthened; To be prepared and strengthened is to be ever-victorious; To be ever-victorious is to have infinite capacity; He who has infinite capacity is fit to rule a country, And the Mother (principle) of a ruling country can long endure. This is to be firmly rooted, to have deep strength, The road to immortality and enduring vision.",
    "Rule a big country as you would fry small fish. Who rules the world in accord with Tao Shall find that the spirits lose their power. It is not that the spirits lose their power, But that they cease to do people harm. It is not (only) that they cease to do people harm, The Sage (himself) also does no harm to the people. When both do not do each other harm, The original character is restored.",
    "A big country (should be like) the delta low-regions, Being the concourse of the world, (And) the Female of the world. The Female overcomes the Male by quietude, And achieves the lowly position by quietude. Therefore if a big country places itself below a small country It absorbs the small country. (And) if a small country places itself below a big country, It absorbs the big country. Therefore some place themselves low to absorb (others), Some are (naturally) low and absorb (others). What a big country wants is but to shelter others, And what a small country wants is but to be able to come in and be sheltered. Thus (considering) that both may have what they want, A big country ought to place itself low.",
    "Tao is the mysterious secret of the universe, The good man's treasure, And the bad man's refuge. Beautiful saying can be sold at the market, Noble conduct can be presented as a gift. Though there be bad people, Why reject them? Therefore on the crowning of an emperor, On the appointment of the Three Ministers, Rather than send tributes of jade and teams of four horses, Send in the tribute of Tao. Wherein did the ancients prize this Tao? Did they not say, 'to search for the guilty ones and pardon them'? Therefore is (tao) the treasure of the world.",
    "Accomplish do-nothing. Attend to no-affairs. Taste the flavorless. Whether it is big or small, many or few, Requite hatred with virtue. Deal with the difficult while yet it is easy; Deal wit the big while yet it is small. The difficult (problems) of the world Must be dealt with while they are yet easy; The great (problems) of the world Must be dealt with while they are yet small. Therefore the Sage by never dealing with great (problems) Accomplishes greatness. He who lightly makes a promise Will find it often hard to keep his faith. He who makes light of many things Will encounter many difficulties. Hence even the Sage regards things as difficult, And for that reason never meets with difficulties.",
    "That which lies still is easy to hold; That which is not yet manifest is easy to forestall; That which is brittle (like ice) easily melts; That which is minute easily scatters. Deal with a thing before it is there; Check disorder before it is rife. A tree with a full span's girth begins from a tiny sprout; A nine-storied terrace begins with a clod of earth. A journey of a thousand li beings at one's feet. He who acts, spoils; He who grasps, lets slip. Because the Sage does not act, he does not spoil, Because he does not grasp, he does not let slip. The affairs of men are often spoiled within an ace of completion. By being careful at the end as at the beginning Failure is averted. Therefore the Sage desires to have no desire, And values not objects difficult to obtain. Learns that which is unlearned, And restores what the multitude have lost. That he may assist in the course of Nature And not presume to interfere.",
    "The ancients who knew how to follow the Tao Aimed not to enlighten the people, But to keep them ignorant. The reason it is difficult for the people to leave in peace Is because of too much knowledge. Those who seek to rule a country by knowledge Are the nation's curse. Those who seek not to rule a country by knowledge Are the nation's blessing. Those who know these two (principles) Also know the ancient standard, And to know always the ancient standard Is called the Mystic Virtue. When the Mystic Virtue becomes clear, far-reaching, And things revert back (to their source) Then and then only emerges the Grand Harmony.",
    "How did the great rivers and seas become the Lords of the ravines? By being good at keeping low. That was how they became Lords of the Ravines. Therefore in order to be the chief among the people, One must speak like their inferiors. In order to be foremost among the people, One must walk behind them. Thus it is that the Sage stays above, And the people do not feel his weight; Walks in front, And the people do not wish him harm. Then the people of the world are glad to uphold him forever. Because he does not contend, No one in the world can contend against him.",
    "All the world says: my teaching (Tao) greatly resembles folly. Because it is great; therefore it resembles folly. If it did not resemble folly, It would have long ago become petty indeed! I have Three Treasures; Guard them and keep them safe: the first is Love. The second is, Never too much. The third is, Never be the first in the world. Through Love, one has no fear; Through not doing too much, one has amplitude (of reserve power); Through not presuming to be the first in the world, One can develop one's talent and let it mature. If one forsakes love and fearlessness, forsakes restraint and reserve power, forsakes following behind and rushes in front, He is doomed! For love is victorious in attack, And invulnerable in defense. Heaven arms with love Those it would not see destroyed.",
    "The brave soldier is not violent; The good fighter does not lose his temper; The great conqueror does not fight (on small issues); The good user of men places himself below others. - This is the virtue of not-contending, Is called the capacity to use men, Is reaching to the height of being Mated to Heaven, to what was of old.",
    "There is the maxim of military strategists; I dare not be the first to invade, but rather be the invaded. Dare not press forward an inch, but rather retreat a foot. That is, to march without formations, To roll up the sleeves, To charge not in frontal attacks, To arm without weapons. There is no greater catastrophe than to underestimate the enemy. To underestimate the enemy might entail the loss of my treasures. Therefore when two equally matched armies meet, It is the man of sorrow who wins.",
    "My teachings are very easy to understand and very easy to practice, But no one can understand them and no one can practice them. In my words there is a principle. In the affairs of men there is a system. Because they know not these, They also know me not. Since there are few that know me, Therefore I am distinguished. Therefore the Sage wears a coarse cloth on top And carries jade within his bosom.",
    "Who knows that he does not know is the highest; Who (pretends to) know what he does not know is sick-minded. And who recognizes sick-mindedness as sick-mindedness is not sick-minded. The Sage is not sick-minded. Because he recognizes sick-mindedness as sick-mindness, Therefore he is not sick-minded.",
    "When people have no fear of force, Then (as is the common practice) great force descends upon them. Despise not their dwellings, Dislike not their progeny. Because you do not dislike them, You will not be disliked yourself. Therefore the Sage knows himself, but does not show himself, Loves himself, but does not exalt himself. Therefore he rejects the one (force) and accepts the other (gentility).",
    "Who is brave in daring (you) kill, Who is brave in not daring (you) let live. In these two, There is some advantage and some disadvantage. (Even if) Heaven dislikes certain people, Who would know (who are to be killed and) why? Therefore even the Sage regards it as a difficult question. Heaven's Way (Tao) is good at conquest without strife, Rewarding (vice and virtue) without words, Making its appearance without call, Achieving results without obvious design. The heaven's net is broad and wide. With big meshes, yet letting nothing slip through.",
    "The people are not afraid of death; Why threaten them with death? Supposing that the people are afraid of death, And we can seize and kill the unruly, Who would dare to do so? Often it happens that the executioner is killed. And to take the place of the executioner Is like handling the hatchet for the master carpenter. He who handles the hatchet for the master carpenter seldom escapes injury to his hands.",
    "When people are hungry, It is because their rulers eat too much tax-grain. Therefore the unruliness of hungry people Is due to the interference of their rulers. That is why they are unruly. The people are not afraid of death, Because they are anxious to make a living. That is why they are not afraid of death. It is those who interfere not with their living That are wise in exalting life.",
    "When man is born, he is tender and weak; At death, he is hard and stiff. When the things and plants are alive, they are soft and supple; When they are dead, they are brittle and dry. Therefore hardness and stiffness are the companions of death, And softness and gentleness are the companions of life. Therefore when an army is headstrong, it will lose in a battle. When a tree is hard, it will be cut down. The big and strong belong underneath. The gentle and weak belong at the top.",
    "The Tao (way) of Heaven, Is it not like the bending of a bow? The top comes down and the bottom-end goes up, The extra (length) is shortened, the insufficient (width) is expanded. It is the way of Heaven to take away from those that have too much And give to those that have not enough. Not so with man's way: He takes from those that have not And gives it as tribute to those that have too much. Who can have enough and to spare to give to the entire world? Only the man of Tao. Therefore the Sage acts, but does not possess, Accomplishes but lays claim to no credit, Because he has no wish to seem superior.",
    "There is nothing weaker than water But none is superior to it in overcoming the hard, For which there is no substitute. That weakness overcomes strength And gentleness overcomes rigidity, No one does not know; No one can put into practice. Therefore the Sage says: 'Who receives unto himself the calumny of the world Is the preserver of the state. Who bears himself the sins of the world Is king of the world.' Straight words seem crooked.",
    "Patching up a great hatred is sure to leave some hatred behind. How can this be regarded as satisfactory? Therefore the Sage holds the left tally, And does not put the guilt on the other party. The virtuous man is for patching up; The vicious is for fixing guilt. But 'the way of Heaven is impartial; It sides only with the good man.'",
    "(Let there be) a small country with a small population, Where the supply of goods are tenfold or hundredfold, more than they can use. Let the people value their lives and not migrate far. Though there be boats and carriages, None be there to ride them. Though there be armor and weapons, No occasion to display them. Let the people again tie ropes for reckoning, Let them enjoy their food, Beautify their clothing, Be satisfied with their homes, Delight in their customs. The neighboring settlements overlook one another So that they can hear the barking of dogs and crowing of cocks of their neighbors, And the people till the end of their days shall never have been outside their country.",
    "True words are not fine-sounding; Fine-sounding words are not true. A good man does not argue; he who argues is not a good man. The wise one does not know many things; He who knows many things is not wise. The Sage does not accumulate (for himself). He lives for other people, And grows richer himself; He gives to other people, And has greater abundance. The Tao of Heaven Blesses, but does not harm. The Way of the Sage Accomplishes, but does not contend.",

    "As for the Way, the Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way; As for names, the name that can be named is not the constant name. The nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things; The named is the mother of the ten thousand things. Therefore, those constantly without desires, by this means will perceive its subtlety. Those constantly with desires, by this means will see only that which they yearn for and seek. These two together emerge; They have different names yet they're called the same; That which is even more profound than the profound - The gateway of all subtleties.",
    "When everyone in the world knows the beautiful as beautiful, ugliness comes into being; When everyone knows the good, then the not good comes to be. The mutual production of being and nonbeing, The mutual completion of difficult and easy, The mutual formation of long and short, The mutual filling of high and low, The mutual harmony of tone and voice, The mutual following of front and back - These are all constants. Therefore the Sage dwells in nonactive affairs and practices the wordless teaching. The ten thousand things arise, but he doesn't begin them; He acts on their behalf, but he doesn't make them dependent; He accomplishes his tasks, but he doesn't dwell on them; It is only because he doesn't dwell on them, that they therefore do not leave them.",
    "By not elevating the worthy, you bring it about that people will not compete. By not valuing goods that are hard to obtain, you bring it about that people will not act like thieves. By not displaying the desirable you bring it about that people will not be confused. Therefore, in the government of the Sage: He empties their minds, And fills their bellies. Weakens their ambition, And strengthens their bones. He constantly causes the people to be without knowledge and without desires. If he can bring it about that those with knowledge simply do not dare to act, Then there is nothing that will not be in order.",
    "The Way is empty; Yet when you use it, you never need fill it again. Like an abyss! It seems to be the ancestor of the ten thousand things. It files down sharp edges; Unties the tangles; Softens the glare; And settles the dust. Submerged! It seems perhaps to exist. We don't know whose child it is; It seems to have (even) preceded the Lord.",
    "Heaven and Earth are not humane; They regard the the thousand things as straw dogs. The Sage is not humane; He regards the common people as straw dogs. The space between Heaven and Earth - is it not like a bellow? It is empty and yet not depleted; Move it and more (always) comes out. Much learning means frequent exhaustions. That's not so good as holding on to the mean.",
    "The valley spirit never dies; We call it the mysterious female. The gates of the mysterious female - These we call the roots of Heaven and Earth. Subtle yet everlasting! It seems to exist. In being used, it is not exhausted.",
    "Heaven endures; Earth lasts a long time. The reason why Heaven and Earth can endure and last a long time - Is that they do not live for themselves. Therefore they can long endure. Therefore the Sage: Puts himself in the background yet finds himself in the foreground; Puts self-concern out of (his mind), yet finds self-concern in the fore; Puts self-concern out of (his mind), yet finds that his self-concern is preserved. Is it not because he has no self-interest, That he is therefore able to realize his self-interest?",
    "The highest good is like water; Water is good at benefiting the ten thousand things and yet it [does not] compete [with them]. It dwells in places the masses of people detest, Therefore it is close to the Way. In dwelling, the good thing is the land; In the mind, the good thing is depth; In giving, the good thing is [being like] Heaven; In speaking, the good thing is sincerity; In governing, the good thing is order; In affairs, the good thing is ability; In activity, the good thing is timeliness. It is only because it does not compete, that therefore it is without fault.",
    "To hold it upright and fill it, Is not so good as stopping [in time]. When you pound it out and give it a point, It won't be preserved very long. When gold and jade fill your rooms, You'll never be able to protect them. Arrogance and pride with wealth and rank, On their own bring on disaster. When the deed is accomplished you retire; Such is Heaven's Way!",
    "In nourishing the soul and embracing the One - can you do it without letting them leave? In concentrating your breath and making it soft - can you (make it like that of) a child? In cultivating and cleaning your profound mirror - can you do it so that it has no blemish? In loving the people and giving life to the state - can you do it without using knowledge? In opening and closing the gates of Heaven - can you play the part of the female? In understanding all within the four reaches - can you do it without using knowledge? Give birth to them and nourish them. Give birth to them but don't try to own them; Help them to grow but don't rule them. This is called Profound Virtue.",
    "Thirty spokes unite in one hub; It is precisely where there is nothing, that we find the usefulness of the wheel. We fire clay and make vessels; It is precisely where there's no substance, that we find the usefulness of clay pots. We chisel out doors and windows; It is precisely in these empty spaces, that we find the usefulness of the room. Therefore, we regard having something as beneficial; But having nothing as useful.",

The five flavors confuse one's palate. The five tones cause one's ears to go deaf. Therefore, in the government of the Sage: He's for the belly and not for the eyes. Thus he rejects that and take this.",
    "'Regard favor and disgrace with alarm.' 'Respect great distress as you do your own person.' What do I mean I say 'Regard favor and disgrace with alarm'? Favor is inferior. If you get it - be alarmed! If you lose it - be alarmed! This is what I mean when I say 'Regard favor and disgrace with alarm.' What do I mean when I say 'Respect great distress as you do your own person'? The reason why I have distress Is that I have a body. If I had no body, what distress would I have? Therefore, to one who values acting for himself over acting on behalf of the world, You can entrust the world. And to one who in being parsimonious regards his person as equal to the world, You can turn over the world.",
    "We look at it but do not see it; We name this 'the minute.' We listen to it but do not hear it; We name this 'the rarefied.' We touch it but do not hold it; We name this 'the level and smooth.' These three cannot be examined to the limit. Thus they merge together as one. 'One' - there is nothing more encompassing above it, And nothing smaller below it. Boundless, formless! It cannot be named, And returns to the state of no-thing. This is called the formless form, The substanceless image. This is called the subtle and indistinct. Follow it and you won't see its back; Greet it and you won't see its head. Hold on to the Way of the present- To manage the things of the present, And to know the ancient beginning. This is called the beginning of the thread of the Way.",
    "The one who was skilled at practicing the Way in antiquity, Was subtle and profound, mysterious and penetratingly wise. His depth cannot be known. It is only because he cannot be known That therefore were I forced to describe him I'd say: Hesitant was he! Like someone crossing a river in winter. Undecided was he! As though in fear of his neighbors on all four sides. Solemn and polite was he! Like a guest. Scattered and dispersed was he! Like an ice as it melts Genuine, unformed was he! Like uncarved wood. Merged, undifferentiated was he! Like muddy water. Broad and expansive was he! Like a valley. If you take muddy water and still it, it gradually becomes clear. If you bring something to rest in order to move it, it gradually comes alive. The one who preserved this Way does not desire to be full; Therefore he can wear out with no need to be renewed.",
    "Take emptiness to the limit; Maintain tranquility in the center. The ten thousand things-side-by-side they arise; And by this I see their return. Things (come forth) in great numbers; Each one returns to its root. This is called tranquility. 'Tranquility' - This means to return to your fate. To return to your fate is to be constant; To know the constant is to be wise. Not to know the constant is to be reckless and wild; If you're reckless and wild, your actions will lead to misfortune. To know the constant is to be all-embracing; To be all-embracing is to be impartial; To be impartial is to be kingly; To be kingly is to be (like) Heaven; To be (like) Heaven is to be (one with) the Dao; If you're (one with) the Dao, to the end of your days you'll suffer no harm.",

And with those at the bottom - they ridicule and insult them. When trust is insufficient, there will be no trust (in them). Hesitant, undecided! Like this is his respect for speaking.",
    "Therefore, when the Great Way is rejected, it is then that we have the virtues of humanity and righteousness; When knowledge and wisdom appear, it is then that there is great hypocrisy; When the six relations are not in harmony, it is then that we have filial piety and compassion; And when the country is in chaos and confusion, it is then that there are virtuous officials.",
    "Eliminate sageliness, throw away knowledge, And the people will benefit a hundredfold. Eliminate humanity, throw away righteousness, And the people will return to filial piety and compassion. Eliminate craftiness, throw away profit, Then we will have no robbers and thieves. These three sayings - Regard as a text are not yet complete. Thus, we must see to it that they have the following appended: Manifest plainness and embrace the genuine; Lessen self-interest and make few your desires; Eliminate learning and have no undue concern.",
    "Agreement and angry rejection; How great is the difference between them? Beautiful and ugly; What's it like - the difference between them? The one who is feared by others, Must also because of this fear other men. Wild, unrestrained! It will never come to an end! The multitudes are peaceful and happy; Like climbing a terrace in springtime to feast at the tai-lao sacrifice. But I'm tranquil and quiet-not yet having given any sign. Like a child who has not yet smiled. Tired and exhausted-as though I have no place to return. The multitudes all have a surplus. I alone seem to be lacking. Mine is the mind of a fool-ignorant and stupid! The common people see things clearly; I alone am in the dark. The common people discriminate and make fine distinctions; I alone am muddled and confused. Formless am I! Like the ocean; Shapeless am I! As though I have nothing in which I can rest. The masses all have their reasons (for acting); I alone am stupid and obstinate like a rustic. But my desires alone differ from those of others - For I value drawing sustenance from the Mother.",
    "The character of great virtue follows alone from the Way. As for the nature of the Way - it's shapeless and formless. Formless! Shapeless! Inside there are images. Shapeless! Formless! Inside there are things. Hidden! Obscure! Inside there are essences. These essences are very real; Inside them is the proof. From the present back to the past, Its name has never gone away. It is by this that we comply with the father of the multitude (of things). How do I know that the father of the multitude is so? By this.",
    "Bent over, you'll be preserved whole; When twisted, you'll be upright; When hollowed out, you'll be full; When worn out, you'll be renewed; When you have little, you'll attain [much]; With much, you'll be confused. Therefore the Sage holds on to the One and in this way becomes the shepherd of the world. He does not show himself off; therefore he becomes prominent. He does not put himself on display; therefore he brightly shines. He does not brag about himself; therefore he receives credit. He does not praise his own deeds; therefore he can long endure. It is only because he does not compete that, therefore, no one is able to compete with him. The so-called 'Bent over you'll be preserved whole' of the ancients Was an expression that was really close to it! Truly 'wholeness' will belong to him.",
    "To rarely speak-such is (the way of) Nature. Fierce winds don't last the whole morning; Torrential rains don't last the whole day. Who makes these things? If even Heaven and Earth can't make these last long - How much the more is this true for man?! Therefore, one who devotes himself to the Way is one with the Way; One who (devotes himself to) Virtue is one with that Virtue; And one who (devotes himself to) losing is one with that loss. To the one who is one with Virtue, the Way also gives Virtue; While for the one who is one with his loss, the Way also disregards him.",
    "One who boasts is not established; One who shows himself off does not become prominent; One who puts himself on display does not brightly shine; One who brags about himself gests no credit; One who praises himself does not long endure. In the Way, such things are called: 'Surplus food and redundant action.' And with things - there are those who hate them. Therefore, the one with the Way in them does not dwell.",
    "There was something formed out of chaos, That was born before Heaven and Earth. Quiet and Still! Pure and deep! It stands on its own and does not change. It can be regarded as the mother of Heaven and Earth. I do not yet know its name: I 'style' it 'the Way.' Were I forced to give it a name, I would call it 'the Great.' 'Great' means 'to depart'; 'To depart' means 'to be far away'; And 'to be far away' means 'to return.' The Way is great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; And the king is also great. In the country there are four greats, and the king occupies one place among them. Man models himself on the Earth; The Earth models itself on Heaven; Heaven models itself on the Way; And the Way models itself on that which is so on its own.",
    "The heavy is the root of the light; Tranquility is the loard of agitation. Therefore the gentleman, in traveling all day, does not get far away from his luggage carts. When he's safely inside a walled-in (protected) hostel and resting at ease - only then does he transcend all concern. How can the king of ten thousand chariots treat his own person more lightly than the whole world?! If you regard things too lightly, then you lose the basic; If you're agitated, you lose the 'lord.'",
    "The good traveler leaves no track behind; The good speaker (speaks) without blemish or flaw; The good counter doesn't use tallies or chips; The good closer of doors does so without bolt or lock, and yet the door cannot be opened; The good tier of knots ties without rope or cord, yet his knots can't be undone. Therefore the Sage is constantly good at saving men and never rejects anyone; And with things, he never rejects useful goods. This is called Doubly Bright. Therefore the good man is the teacher of the good, And the bad man is the raw material for the good. To not value one's teacher and not cherish the raw goods - Though one had great knowledge, he would still be greatly confused. This is called the Essential of the Sublime.",
    "When you know the male yet hold on to the female, You'll be the ravine of the country. When you're the ravine of the country, Your constant virtue will not leave. And when your constant virtue doesn't leave, You'll return to the state of the infant. When you know the pure yet hold on to the soiled, You'll be the valley of the country. When you're the valley of the country, Your constant virtue is complete. And when your constant virtue is complete, You'll return to the state of uncarved wood. When you know the white yet hold on to the black, You'll be the model for the country. And when you're the model for the country, Your constant virtue will not go astray. And when your constant virtue does not go astray, You'll return to the condition which has no limit. When uncarved wood is cut up, it's turned into vessels; When the Sage is used, he becomes the Head of Officials. Truly, great carving is done without splitting up.",
    "For those who would like to take control of thw world and act on it - I see that with this they simply will not succeed. The world is a sacred vessel; It is not something that can be acted upon. Those who act on it destroy it; Those who hold on to it lose it. With things - some go forward, others follow; Some are hot, others submissive and weak; Some rise up while others fall down. Therefore the Sage: Rejects the extreme, the excessive, and the extravagant.",
    "Those who assist their rulers with the Way, Don't use weapons to commit violence in the world. Such deeds easily rebound. In places where armies are stationed, thorns and brambles will grow. The good (general) achieves his result and that's all; He does not use the occasion to seize strength from it. He achieves his result but does not become arrogant; He achieves his result but does not praise his deeds; He achieves his result and yet does not brag. He achieves his result, yet he abides with the result because he has no choice. This is called achieving one's result [without] using force. When things reach their primes, they get old; We called this 'not the Way.' What is not the Way will come to an early end.",
    "As for weapons - they are instruments of ill omen. And among things there are those that hate them. Therefore, the one who has the Way, with them does not dwell. When the gentleman is at home, he honors the left; When at war, he honors the right. Therefore, weapons are not the instrument of the gentleman - Weapons are instruments of ill omen. When you have no choice but to use them, it's best to remain tranquil and calm. You should never look upon them as things of beauty. If you see them as beautiful things - this is to delight in the killing of men. And when you delight in the killing of men, you'll not realize your goal in the land. Therefore, in happy events we honor the left, But in mourning we honor the right. Therefore, the lieutenant general stands on the left; And the supreme general stands on the right. Which is to say, they arrange themselves as they would at a funeral. When multitudes of people are killed, we stand before them in sorrow and grief. When we're victorious in battle, we treat the occasion like a funeral ceremony.",
    "The Dao is constantly nameless. Though in its natural state it seems small, no one in the world dares to treat it as a subject. Were marquises and kings able to maintain it, The ten thousand things would submit to them on their own, And Heaven and Earth would unite to send forth sweet dew. By nature it would fall equally on all things, with no one among the people ordering that it be so. As soon as we start to establish a system, we have names. And as soon as there are set names, Then you must also know that it's time to stop. By knowing to stop - in this way you'll come to no harm. The Way's presence in the world Is like the relationship of small valley (streams) to rivers and seas.",
    "To understand others is to be knowledgeable; To understand yourself is to be wise. To conquer others is to have strength; To conquer yourself is to be strong. To know when you have enough is to be rich. To go forward with strength is to have ambition. To not lose your place is to last long. To die but not be forgotten - that's (true) long life.",
    "The Way floats and drifts; It can go left or right. It accomplishes its tasks and completes its affairs, and yet for this it is not given a name. The ten thousand things entrust their lives to it, and yet it does not act as their master. Thus it is constantly without desires. It can be named with the things that are small. The ten thousand things entrust their lives to it, and yet it does not not act as their master. It can be named with the things that are great. Therefore the Sage's ability to accomplish the great Comes from his not playing the role of the great. Therefore he is able to accomplish the great.",
    "Hold on to the Great Image and the whole world will come to you. Come to you and suffer no harm; but rather know great safety and peace. Music and food - for these passing travelers stop. Therefore, of the Dao's speaking, we say: Insipid, it is! It's lack of flavor. When you look at it, it's not sufficient to be seen; When you listen to it, it's not sufficient to be heard; Yet when you use it, it can't be used up.",
    "If you wish to shrink it, You must certainly stretch it. If you wish to weaken it, You must certainly strengthen it. If you wish to desert it, You must certainly work closely with it. If you wish to snatch something from it, You must certainly give something to it. This is called the Subtle Light. The submissive and weak conquer the strong. Fish should not be taken out of the depths; The state's sharp weapons should not be shown to the people.",
    "The Dao is constantly nameless. Were Marquises and kings able to maintain it, The ten thousand things would transform on their own. Having transformed, were their desires to become active, I would subdue them with the nameless simplicity. Having subdued them with the nameless simplicity, I would not disgrace them. By not being disgraced, they will be tranquil. And Heaven and Earth will of themselves be correct and right.",
    "The highest virtue is not virtuous; therefore it truly has virtue. The lowest virtue never loses sight of its virtue; therefore it has no true virtue. The highest virtue takes no action, yet it has no reason for acting this way; The highest humanity takes action, yet it has no reason for acting this way; The highest righteousness takes action, and it has its reason for acting this way; The highest propriety takes action, and when no one responds to it, then it angrily rolls up its sleeves and forces people to comply. Therefore, when the Way is lost, only then do we have virtue; When virtue is lost, only then do we have humanity; When humanity is lost, only then do we have righteousness; And when righteousness is lost, only then do we have propriety. As for propriety, it's but the thin edge of loyalty and sincerity, and the beginning of disorder. And foreknowledge is but the flower of the Way, and the beginning of stupidity. Therefore the Great Man Dwells in the thick and doesn't dwell in the thin; Dwells in the fruit and doesn't dwell in the flower. Therefore, he rejects that and takes this.",
    "Of those in the past that attained the One - Heaven, by attaining the One became clear; Earth, by attaining the One became stable; Gods, by attaining the One became divine; Valley, by attaining the One became full; Marquises and kings, by attaining the One made the whole land ordered and secure. Taking this to its logical conclusion we would say - If Heaven were not by means of it clear, it would, I'm afraid, shatter; If the Earth were not by means of it stable, it would, I'm afraid, let go. If the gods were not by means of it divine, they would, I'm afraid, be powerless. If valley were not by means of it full, they would, (I'm afraid), dry up. And if marquises and kings were not by means of it noble and high, they would, I'm afraid, topple and fall. Therefore, it must be the case that the noble has the base as its root; And it must be the case that the high has the low for its foundation. Thus, for this reason, marquises and kings call themselves 'The Orphan,' 'The Widower,' and 'The One Without Grain.' This is taking the base as one's root, is it not?! Therefore, they regard their large numbers of carriages as having no carriage. And because of this, they desire not to dazzle and glitter like jade, But to remain firm and strong like stone.",
    "'Reversal' is the movement of the Dao; 'Weakness' is the function of the Dao. The things of the world originate in being, And being originates in nonbeing.",
    "When the highest type of men hear the Way, with diligence they're able to practice it; When the average men hear the Way, some things they retain and others they lose; When the lowest type of men hear the Way, they laugh out loud at it. If they didn't laught at it, it couldn't be regarded as the Way. Therefore, there is a set saying about this that goes: The bright Way appears to be dark; The Way that goes forward appears to retreat; The smooth Way appears to be uneven; The highest virtue (is empty) like a valley; The purest white appears to be soiled; Vast virtue appears to be insufficient; Firm virtue appears thin and weak; The simplest reality appears to change. The Great Square has no corners; The Great Vessel takes long to complete; The Great Tone makes little sound; The Great Image has no shape. The Way is Great but has no name. Only the Way is good at beginning things and also good at bringing things to completion.",
    "The Way gave birth to the One. The One gave birth to the Two. The Two gave birth to the Three. And the Three gave birth to the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things carry Yin on their backs and wrap their arms around Yang. Through the blending of the qi they arrive at a state of harmony. The things that are hated by the whole world Are to be orphaned, widowed, and have no grain. Yet kings and dukes take these as their names. Thus with all things - some are increased by taking away; While some are diminished by adding on. Therefore, what other men teach, (I) will also consider and then teach to others. Thus, 'The strong and violent do not come to a natural end.' I will take this as the father of my studies.",
    "The softest, most pliable thing in the world runs roughshod over the firmest things in the world. That which has no substance gets into that which has no spaces or cracks. I therefore know that there is benefit in taking no action. The wordless teaching, the benefit of taking no action - Few in the world can realize these!",
    "Fame or your body - which is more dear? Your body or possessions - which is worth more? Gain or loss - in which is there harm? If your desires are great, you're bound to be extravagant; If your store much away, you're bound to lose a great deal. Therefore, if you know contentment, you'll not be disgraced. If you know when to stop, you'll suffer no harm. And in this way you can last a very long time.",
    "Great completion seems incomplete; Yet its usefulness is never exhausted. Great fullness seems to be empty; Yet its usefulness is never used up. Great straightness seems to be bent. Great skill seems to be clumsy. Great surplus seems to stammer. Activity overcomes cold; Tranquility overcomes heat. If you're quiet and tranquil you can become the ruler of the world.",
    "When the world has the Way, ambling horses are retired to fertilize (fields). When the world lacks the Way, war horses are reared in the suburbs. Of crimes - none is greater than having things that one desires; Of disasters - none is greater than not knowing when one has enough. Of defects - none brings more sorrow than one desire to attain. Therefore, the contentment one has when he knows that he has enough, is abiding contentment indeed.",
    "No need to leave your door to know the whole world; No need to peer through your windows to know the Way of Heaven. The farther you go, the less you know. Therefore the Sage knows without going, Names without seeing, And completes without doing a thing.",
    "Those who work at their studies increase day after day; Those who have heard the Dao decrease day after day. They decrease and decrease, till they get to the point where they do nothing. They do nothing and yet there's nothing left undone. When someone wants to take control of the world, he must always be unconcerned with affairs. For in a case where he's concerned with affairs, He'll be unworthy, as well, of taking control of the world.",
    "The Sage constantly has no (set) mind; He takes the mind of the common people as his mind. Those who are good he regards as good; Those who are not good he also regards as good. (In this way) he attains goodness. Those who are trustworthy he trusts; And those who are not trustworthy he also trusts. (In this way) he gets their trust. As for the Sage's presence in the world - he is one with it. And with the world he merges his mind. The common people all fix their eyes and ears on him. And the Sage treats them all as his children.",
    "We come out into life and go back into death. The companions of life are thirteen; The companions of death are thirteen; And yet people, because they regard life as LIFE, in all of their actions move towards the thirteen that belong to the realm of death. Now, why is this so? It's because they regard life as LIFE. You've no doubt heard of those who are good at holding on to life: When walking through hills, they don't avoid rhinos and tigers; When they go into battle, they don't put on armor or shields; The rhino has no place to probe with its horn; The tiger finds no place to put its claws. And weapons find no place to hold their blades. Now, why is this so? Because there is no place for death in them.",
    "The Way gives birth to them and Virtue nourishes them; Substance gives them form and their unique capacities complete them. Therefore the ten thousand things venerate the Way and honor Virtue. As for their veneration of the Way and their honoring of Virtue - No one rewards them for it; it's constantly so on its own. The Way gives birth to them, nourishes them, matures them, completes them, rests them, rears them, supports them, and protects them. It gives birth to them but doesn't try to own them; It acts on their behalf but doesn't make them dependent; It matures them but doesn't rule them. This we call Profound Virtue.",

If you return and hold on to the mother, till the end of your life you'll suffer no harm. Block up the holes; Close the doors; And till the end of your life you'll not labor. Open the holes; Meddle in affairs; And till the end of your life you'll not be saved. To receive the small is called 'discernment.' To hold on to the pliant is called 'strength.' If you use the rays to return to the bright light, You'll not abandon your life to peril. This is called Following the Constant.",
    "Were I to have the least bit of knowledge, in walking on a Great Rod, it's only going astray that I would fear. The Great Way is very level; But people greatly delight in tortuous paths. The courts are swept very clean; While the fields are full of weeds; And the granaries are all empty. Their clothing - richly embroidered and colored; While at their waists they carry sharp swords. They gorge themselves on food, and of possessions and goods they have plenty. This is called thievery! And thievery certainly isn't the Way!",

When you cultivate it in your person, your virtue will then be genuine; When you cultivate it in your family, your virtue will then be overflow; When you cultivate it in your village, your virtue will then be long lasting; When you cultivate it in your state, your virtue will then be abundant; And when you cultivate it throughout the world, your virtue will then be widespread. Use the individual to examine the individual; Use the family to examine the family; Use the village to examine the village; Use the state to examine the state; And use the world to examine the world; How do I know that the world is so? By this.",
    "One who embraces the fullness of Virtue, Can be compared to a newborn babe. Wasps and scorpions, snakes and vipers do not sting him; Birds of prey and fierce beasts do not seize him; His bones and muscles are weak and pliant, yet his grasp is firm; He does not yet know the meeting of male and female, yet his organ is aroused - This is because his essence is at its height. He can scream all day, yet he won't become hoarse - This is because his harmony is at its height. To know harmony is called 'the constant'; To know the constant is called 'being wise'; To add on to life is called a 'bad omen'; For the mind to control the breath - that's called 'forcing things.' When things reach their prime they get old; This is called 'not the Way.' What is not the Way will come to an early end.",
    "Those who know don't talk about it; those who talk don't know it. He blocks up his holes, Closes his doors, Softens the glare, Settles the dust, Files down the sharp edges, And unties the tangles. This is called Profound Union. Therefore, there is no way to get intimate with him, But there is also no way to shun him. There is no way to benefit him, But there is also no way to harm him. There is no way to ennoble him, But there is also no way to debase him. For this very reason he's the noblest thing in the world.",
    "Use the upright and correct to order the state; Use surprise tactics when you use troops; Use unconcern with affairs to take control of the world. How do I know that this is so? Well, the more taboos and prohibitions there are in the world, the poorer the people will be; The more sharp weapons the people possess, the more muddled the states will be; The more knowledge and skill people have, the more novel things will appear; The more legal matters are made prominent, the more robbers and thieves there will be. Therefore, the words of the Sage say: I do nothing, and the people of themselves are transformed; I love tranquility, and the people of themselves are upright; I'm unconcerned with affairs, and the people of themselves become rich. I desire not to desire, and the people of themselves are (genuine and simple, like) uncarved wood.",
    "When the government is muddled and confused, The people are genuine and sincere. When the government is discriminate and clear, The state is crafy and cunning. Disaster is that on which good fortune depends. Good fortune is that in which disaster's concealed. Who knows where it will end? For there is no (fixed) 'correct.' The 'correct' turns into the 'deviant'; And 'good' turns into 'evil.' People's state of confusion Has certainly existed for a long time. Therefore be square but don't cut; Be sharp but don't stab; Be straightforward but not unrestrained; Be bright but don't dazzle.",
    "For ordering humanity and serving Heaven, nothing's so good as being sparing. For only if you are sparing can you, therefore, early submit (to the Way). Early submission - this is called to repeatedly accumulate Virtue. If you repeatedly accumulate Virtue, then there is nothing you can't overcome. When there is nothing you can't overcome, no one knows where it will end. When no one knows where it will end, you can possess the state. And when you possess the mother of the state, you can last a very long time. This is called [having] deep roots and a firm base, It's the Way of long life and long-lasting vision.",
    "Ruling a large state is like cooking small fish. When you use the Way to govern the world, evil spirits won't have godlike power. Actually, it's not that evil spirits won't have godlike power, It's that their power will not harm men. But it's not (just) that their power won't harm men, The Sage, also, will not harm them. Since these two do not harm others, Therefore their Virtues intermingle and return to them.",
    "The large state is like the lower part of a river; It is the female of the world; It is the meeting point of the world. The female constantly overcomes the male with tranquility. Because she is tranquil, therefore she is fittingly underneath. The large state - if it is below the small state, then it takes over the small state; The small state - if it is below the large state, then it is taken over by the large state. Therefore some by being low take over, And some by being low are taken over. Therefore the large state merely desires to unite and rear others; While the small state merely desires to enter and serve others. If both get what they want, Then the large state should fittingly be underneath.",
    "The Way is that toward which all things flow. It is the treasure of the good man, And that which protects the bad. Beautiful words can be bought and sold; Honored deeds can be presented to others as gifts; (Even with) things that people regard as no good - will they be rejected? Therefore, when the So of Heaven is being enthroned or the Three Ministers installed, Though you might salture them which disks of jade preceded by teams of four horses, That's not so good as sitting still and offering this. The reason why the ancients valued this - what was it? Did they not say, 'Those who seek, with this will attain, and those who commit offenses, with this will escape'?! Therefore, it's the most valued thing in the world.",
    "Act without acting; Serve without concern for affairs; Find flavor in what has no flavor. Regard the small as large and the few as many, And repay resentment with kindness. Plan for the difficult while it is easy; Act on the large while it's minute. The most difficult things in the world begin as things that are easy; The largest things in the world arise from the minute. Therefore the Sage, to the end does not strive to do the great, And as a result, he is able to accomplish the great; Those who too lightly agree will necessarily be trusted by few; And those who regard many things as easy will necessarily (end up) with many difficulties. Therefore, even the Sage regards things as difficult, And as a result, in the end he has no difficulty.",
    "What is at rest is easy to hold; What has not yet given a sign is easy to plan for; The brittle is easily shattered; The minute is easily scattered; Act on it before it comes into being; Order it before it turns into chaos. A tree (so big) that it takes both arms to surround starts out as the tiniest shoot; A nine-story terrace rises up from a basket of dirt. A high place one hundred, one thousand feet high begins from under your feet. Those who act on it ruin it; Those who hold on to it lose it. Therefore the Sage does not act, And as a result, he doesn't ruin (things); He does not hold on to (things), And as a result, he doesn't lose (things); In people's handling of affairs, they always ruin things when they're right at the point of completion. Therefore we say, 'If you're as careful at the end as you were at the beginning, you'll have no failures.' Therefore the Sage desires not to desire and doesn't value goods that are hard to obtain; He learns not to learn and returns to what the masses pass by; He could help all things to be natural, yet he dare not do it.",
    "Those who practiced the Way in antiquity, Did not use it to enlighten the people. Rather, they used it to make them dumb. Now the reason why people are difficult to rule is because of their knowledge; As a result, to use knowledge to rule the state Is thievery of the state; To use ignorance to rule the state Is kindness to the state. One who constantly understands these two, Also (understands) the principle. To constantly understand the principle - This is called Profound Virtue. Profound Virtue is deep, is far-reaching, And together with things it returns. Thus we arrive at the Great Accord.",
    "The reason why rivers and oceans are able to be the kings of the one hundred valleys is that they are good at being below them. For this reason they are able to be the kings of the one hundred valleys. Therefore in the Sage's desire to be above the people, He must in his speech be below them. And in his desire to be at the front of the people, He must in his person be behind them. Thus he dwells above, yet the people do not regard him as heavey; And he dwells in front, yet the people do not see him as posing a threat. The whole world delights in his praise and never tires of him. Is it not because he is not contentious, That, as a result, no one in the world can contend with him?!",
    "The whole world says, I'm Great; Great, yet unlike (everyone else), But it's precisely because I'm unlike (everyone else), that I'm therefore able to be Great. Were I like (everyone else), for a long time now I'd have seemed insignificant and small. I constantly have three treasures; Hold on to them and treasure them. The first is compassion; The second is frugality; And the third is not presuming to be at the forefront in the world. Now, it's because I'm compassionate that I therefore can be courageous; And it's because I'm frugal that I therefore can be magnamimous; And it's because I don't presume to be at the forefront in the world that I therefore can be the head of those with complete talent. Now, if you abandon this compassion and yet try to be courageous, And if you abandon this frugality and yet try to be magnanimous, And if you abandon this staying behind and yet go to the fore, Then you will die. If with compassion you attack, then you'll win; If you defend, then you'll stand firm. When Heaven's about to establish him, It's as though he surrounds him with the protective wall of compassion.",
    "Therefore, one who is good at being a warrior doesn't make a show of his might; One who is good in battle doesn't get angry; One who is good at defeating the enemy doesn't engage him. And one who is good at using men places himself below them. This is called the virtue of not competing; This is called (correctly) using men; This is called matching Heaven. It's the high point of the past.",
    "Those who use weapons have a saying which goes: 'I don't presume to act like the host, and instead play the part of the guest; I don't advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.' This is called moving forward without moving forward - Rolling up one's sleeves without baring one's arms - Grasping firmly without holding a weapon - And enticing to fight when there's no opponent. Of disasters, none is greater than (thinking) you have no rival. To think you have no rival is to come close to losing my treasures. Therefore, when weapons are raised and (the opponents) are farily well matched, Then it's the one who feels grief that will win.",
    "My words are easy to understand, And easy to put into practice. Yet no one in the world can understand them, And no one can put them into practice. Now my words have an ancestor, and my deeds have a lord, And it's simply because (people) have no understanding (of them), that they therefore don't understand me. But when those who understand me are few, then I'm of great value. Therefore the Sage wears coarse woolen cloth, but inside it he holds on to jade.",
    "To know you don't know is best. Not to know you (don't) know is a flaw. Therefore, the Sage's not being flawed Stems from his recognizing a flaw as a flaw. Therefore, he is flawless.",
    "When the people don't respect those in power, then what they greatly fear is about to arrive. Don't narrow the size of the places in which they live; Don't oppress them in their means of livelihood. It's simply because you do not oppress them, that they therefore will not be fed up. Therefore the Sage knows himself but doesn't show himself; He cherishes himself but doesn't value himself. For this reason, he rejects that and takes this.",
    "If you're brave in being daring, you'll be killed; If you're brave in not being daring, you'll live. With these two things, in one case there's profit, in the other there's harm. The things Heaven hates - who knows why? The Way of Heaven is not to fight yet to be good at winning - Not to speak yet skillfully respond - No one summons it, yet it comes on its own - To be at ease yet carefully plan. Heaven's net is large and vast; Its mesh may be coarse yet nothing slips through.",
    "If the people were constant (in their behavior) and yet did not fear death, How could you use execution to intimidate them? If you brought it about that the people were constant (in their behavior) and moreover feared, and (we) took those who behaved in abnormal ways and killed them - who would dare act in this way?! If the people are constant and moreover necessarily fear death, then we constantly have the one in charge of executions. Now killing people in place of the one in charge of executions, this (is like) cutting wood in place of the head carpenter. And of those who cut wood in place of the head carpenter, very few do not hurt their hands!",
    "The reason why people starve, Is because they take so much in tax-grain. Therefore they starve. The reason why the common people cannot be ruled, Is because their superiors have their reason for acting. Therefore they cannot be ruled. The reason why people take death lightly, Is because they so avidly seek after life. Therefore they take death lightly. Only those who do not act for the purpose of living - Only these are superior to those who value life.",
    "When people are born, they're supple and soft; Whey they die, they end up stretched out firm and rigid; When the ten thousand things and grasses and trees are alive, they're supple and pliant; When they're dead, they're withered and dried out. Therefore we say that the firm and rigid are compassions of death, While the supple, the soft, the weak, and the delicate are compassions of life. If a soldier is rigid, he won't win; If a tree is rigid, it will come to its end. Rigidity and power occupy the inferior position; Suppleness, softness, weakness, and delicateness occupy the superior position.",
    "The Way of Heaven is like the flexing of a bow. The high it presses down; the low it raises up. From those with a surplus it takes away; to those without enough it adds on. Therefore the way of Heaven - Is to reduce the excessive and increase the insufficient; The Way of Man - Is to reduce the insufficient and offer more to the excessive. Now, who is able to have a surplus and use it to offer to Heaven? Clearly, it's only the one who possesses the Way. Therefore the Sage - Take actions but does not possess them; Accomplishes his tasks but does not dwell on them. Like this, is his desire not to make a display of his worthiness.",
    "In the whole world, nothing is softer and weaker than water. And yet for attacking the hard and strong, nothing can bear it, Because there is nothing you can use to replace it. That water can defeat the unyielding - That the weak can defeat the strong - There is no one in the whole world who doesn't know it, And yet there is no one who can put it into practice. For this reason, the words of the Sage say: To take on yourself the disgrace of the state - this is called being the lord of (the altars of) earth and grain; To assume responsibility for all ill-omened events in the state - this is called being the king of the world. Correct words seem to say the reverse (of what you expect them to say).",
    "To make peace where there has been great resentment, there is bound to be resentment left over. How could this be regarded as good? Therefore the Sage (holds) the right tally yet makes no demands of others. For this reason, those who have virtue are in charge of the tally; Those without virtue are in charge of the taxes. The Way of Heaven has no favorites, It's always with the good man.",
    "Let the country be small and people few - Bring it about that there are weapons for 'tens' and 'hundreds,' yet let no one use them; Have the people regard death gravely and put migrating far from their minds. Though they might have boats and carriages, no one will ride them; Though they might have armor and spears, no one will display them. Have the people return to knotting cords and using them. They will relish their food, Regard their clothing as beautiful, Delight in their customs, And feel safe and secure in their homes. Neighboring states might overlook one another, And the sounds of chickens and dogs might be overheard, Yet the people will arrive at old age and death with no comings and goings between them.",
    "Sincere words are not showy; Showy words are not sincere. Those who know are not 'widely learned'; Those 'widely learned' do not know. The good do not have a lot; Those with a lot are not good. The Sage accumulates nothing. Having used what he had for others, He has even more. Having given what he had to others, What he has is even greater. Therefore, the Way of Heaven is to benefit and not cause any harm; The Way of Man is to act on behalf of others and not to compete with them.",

    "The way that becomes a way is not the Immortal Way. The name that becomes a name is not the Immortal Name. The maiden of Heaven and Earth has no name. The mother of all things has a name. Thus in innocence we see the beginning. In passion we see the end. Two different names for one and the same, the one we call dark. The dark beyond dark. The door to all beginnings.",
    "All the world knows beauty but if that becomes beautiful this becomes ugly. All the world knows good but if that becomes good this becomes bad. The coexistence of have and have not. The coproduction of hard and easy. The correlation of long and short. The codependence of high and low. The correspondence of note and noise. The coordination of first and last. - Is endless. Thus the sage performs effortless deeds and teaches wordless lessons. He doesn't start all the things he begins. He doesn't presume on what he does. He doesn't claim what he achieves and because he makes no claim he suffers no loss.",
    "Bestowing no honors keeps people from fighting. Prizing no treasures keeps people from stealing. Displaying no attractions keeps people from making trouble. Thus the rule of the sage empties the mind but fills the stomach, weakens the will but strengthens the bones. By keeping the people from knowing or wanting, and those who know from daring to act, he thus governs them all.",
    "The Tao is so empty those who use it never become full again. And so deep as if it were the ancestor of us all. Dulling our edges, untying our tangles, softening our light, merging our dust. And so clear as if it were present. I wonder whose child it is. It seems it was here before Ti.",
    "Heaven and Earth are heartless, treating creatures like straw dogs. Heartless is the sage, treating people like straw dogs. Between Heaven and Earth how like a bellows. Empty but inexhaustible each movement produces more. Talking only wastes it. Better to keep it inside.",
    "The valley spirit that doesn't die we call the dark womb. The dark womb's mouth we call the source of creation. As real as gossamer silk and yet we can't exhaust it.",
    "Heaven is eternal and Earth is immortal. The reason they're eternal and immortal is because they don't live for themselves, hence they can live forever. Thus the sage pulls himself back but ends up in front. He lets himself go but ends up safe. Selflessness must be the reason. Whatever he seeks he finds.",
    "The best are like water. Bringing help to all without competing. Choosing what others avoid, hence approaching the Tao. Dwelling with earth. Thinking with depth. Helping with kindness. Speaking with truth. Governing with peace. Working with skill. Moving with time. And because they don't compete they aren't maligned.",
    "Instead of pouring in more, better stop while you can. Making it sharper won't help it last longer. Houses full of treasure can never be safe. The vanity of success invites its own failure. Retire when your work is done. This is the Way of Heaven.",

Can you be the female at Heaven's Gate? Can you light up the world without knowledge? Beget things and keep them, but beget without possessing. Keep without controlling. This is Dark Virtue.",
    "Thirty spokes converge on a hub, but it's the emptiness that makes a wheel work. Pots are fashioned from clay, but it's the hollow that makes a pot work. Windows and doors are carved for a house, but it's the spaces that make a house work. Existence makes something useful, but nonexistence makes it work.",
    "The five colors make our eyes blind. The five tones make our ears deaf. The five flavors make our mouths numb. Riding and hunting make our minds wild. Hard-to-get goods make us break laws. Thus the rule of the sage puts the stomach ahead of the eyes. Thus he picks this over that.",
    "Favor and disgrace are like warnings. Honor and disaster are like the body. And why are favor and disgrace like warnings? Favor means descending. To gain it is like a warning. To lose it is like a warning. Thus are favor and disgrace like warnings. And why are honor and disaster like the body? The reason we have disaster is because we have a body. If we didn't have a body we wouldn't have disaster. Who honors his body as much as the world can be entrusted with the world. Who loves his body as much as the world can be encharged with the world.",
    "We look but don't see it and call it indistinct. We listen but don't hear it and call it faint. We reach but don't grasp it and call it ethereal. Three failed means to knowledge I weave into one. With no light above, with no shade below, too fine to be named, returning to nothing. This is the formless form, the immaterial image. This is the waxing waning. We meet without seeing its face. We follow without seeing its back. Holding onto this very Way we rule this very realm and discover its ancient past. This is the thread of the Way.",
    "The ancient masters of the Way aimed at the indiscernible and penetrated the dark. You would never know them and because you wouldn't know them I describe them with reluctance. They were careful as if crossing a river in winter. Cautious as if worried about neighbors. Reserved like guests. Ephemeral like melting ice. Simple like uncarved wood. Open like valleys and murky like puddles. But a puddle becomes clear when it's still, and stillness becomes alive when it's roused. Those who treasure this Way don't try to be full. Not trying to be full they can hide and stay hidde.",
    "Let limits be empty, the center be still. Ten thousand things rise, we watch them return. Creatures without number all return to their roots. Return to their roots to be still. To be still to revive, to revive to endure. Knowing how to endure is wisdom, not knowing is to suffer in vain. Knowing how to endure is to be all-embracing. All-embracing means impartial, impartial means the king, the king means Heaven, Heaven means the Way, and the Way means long life. Life without trouble.",
    "During the High Ages people knew they were there. Then people loved and praised them. Then they feared them. Finally they despised them. When honesty fails dishonesty prevails. Hesitate and guard your words. When their work succeeds let people think they did it.",

    "Get rid of wisdom and reason and people will live a hundred times better. Get rid of kindness and justice and people once more will love and obey. Get rid of cleverness and profit and thieves will cease to exist. But these three sayings are not enough, hence let this be added - wear the undyed and hold the uncarved, reduce self-interest and limit desires, get rid of learning and problems will vanish.",
    "Yes and no aren't so far apart. Lovely and ugly aren't so unalike. What others fear we too must fear. Before the moon wanes everyone is gay, as if they were at the Great Sacrifice or climbing a tower in spring. I sit here and make no sign, like a child that doesn't smile. Lost with no one to turn to while others enjoy more. I alone seem forgotten. My mind is so foolish, so simple, others look bright. I alone seem dim. Others are certain. I alone am confused, receding like the ocean, waxing without cease. Everyone has a goal. I alone am dumb and backward for I alone choose to differ, preferring still my mother's breast.",
    "The expression of empty virtue comes from the Tao alone. The Tao as a thing waxes and wanes. It waxes and wanes but inside is an image. It wanes and waxes but inside is a creature. It's distant and dark but inside is an essence. An essence fundamentally real and inside is a heart. Throughout the ages its name has never changed so we might follow our fathers. How do we know what our fathers were like? Through this.",
    "Partial means whole, crooked means straight, hollow means full, worn-out means new, less means content, more means confused. Thus the sage holds onto the one to use in guiding the world. Not watching himself he appears. Not displaying himself he flourishes. Not flattering himself he succeeds. Not parading himself he leads. Because he doesn't compete no one can compete against him. The ancients who said partial means whole came close indeed. Becoming whole depends on this.",

If Heaven and Earth can't make things last, what about Man? Thus in whatever we do, let those on the Way be one with the Way. Let those who succeed be one with success. Let those who fail be one with failure. Be one with success for the Way succeeds too. Be one with failure for the Way fails too.",

    "Imagine a nebulous thing, here before Heaven and Earth. Silent and elusive, it stands alone not wavering, it travels everywhere unharmed. It could be the mother of us all. Not knowing its name I call it the Tao. Forced to name it I name it Great. Great means ever-flowing. Ever-flowing means far-reaching. Far-reaching means returning. The Tao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, the king is also great. The realm contains four greats, of these the king is one. Man imitates Earth. Earth imitates Heaven. Heaven imitates the Tao. The Tao imitates itself.",
    "Heavy is the root of light. Still is the master of busy. Thus a lord might travel all day, but never far from his supplies. Even in a guarded camp his manner is calm and aloof. Why would the lord of ten thousand chariots treat himself lighter than his kingdom? Too light he loses his base. Too busy he loses command.",
    "Good walking leaves no tracks. Good talking reveals no flaws. Good counting counts no beads. Good closing locks no locks and yet it can't be opened. Good tying ties no knots and yet it can't be undone. Thus the sage is good at saving and yet abandons no one nor anything of use. This is called cloaking the light. Thus the good instruct the bad. The bad learn from the good. Not honoring their teachers, not cherishing their students, the wise alone are perfectly blind. This is called peering into the distance.",
    "Recognize the male, but hold onto the female and be the world's maid. Being the world's maid, don't lose your ancient virtue. Not losing your ancient virtue, be a newborn child again. Recognize the pure, but hold onto the defiled and be the world's valley. Being the world's valley, be filled with ancient virtue. Being filled with ancient virtue, be uncarved wood again. Recognize the white, but hold onto the black and be the world's guide. Being the world's guide, don't stray from ancient virtue. Not straying from ancient virtue, be without limits again. Uncarved wood can be split to make tools. The sage makes it his chief official. A master tailor doesn't cut.",
    "Trying to govern the world with force - I see this not succeeding. The world is a spiritual thing, it can't be forced. To force it is to harm it. To control it is to lose it. Sometimes things lead, sometimes they follow. Sometimes blow hot, sometimes blow cold. Sometimes expand, sometimes collapse. Therefore the sage avoids extremes, avoids extravagance, avoids excess.",
    "Use the Tao to help your king. Don't use weapons to rule the land, such things soon return. Where armies camp, brambles grow. Best to win then stop. Don't make use of force. Win but don't be proud. Win but don't be vain. Win but don't be cruel. Win when you have no choice. This is to win without force. Virility means old age. This isn't the Tao. What isn't the Tao ends early.",
    "Weapons are not auspicious tools, some things are simply bad. Thus the Taoist shuns them. In peace the ruler honors the left, in war he honors the right. Weapons are not auspicious, weapons are not a ruler's tools. He wields them when he has no choice. Dispassion is the best, thus he does not beautify them. He who beautifies them enjoys killing others. He who enjoys killing others achieves no worldly rule. Thus we honor the left for joy, we honor the right for sorrow. The left is where the adjutant stands, the commander on the right. Which means as at a funeral, when you kill another, honor him with your tears. When the battle is won, treat it as a wake.",
    "The Tao has never had a name. Simple and though small, no one can command it. If a lord upheld it, the world would be his guest. When Heaven joins with Earth, they bestow sweet dew. No one gives the order, it comes down to all. The first distinction gives us names. After we have names, we should know restraint. Who knows restraint knows no trouble. To picture the Tao in the world, imagine rivers and the sea.",
    "Who knows others is perceptive, who knows himself is wise. Who conquers others is forceful, who conquers himself is strong. Who knows contentment is wealthy. Who strives hard succeeds. Who doesn't lose his place endures. Who dies but doesn't perish lives on.",
    "The Tao drifts, it can go left or right. Everything lives by its grace, but it doesn't speak. When its work succeeds, it makes no claim. It has no desires. Shall we call it small. Everything turns to it, but it wields no control. Shall we call it great. Therefore the sage never acts great, thus he can do great things.",
    "Hold up the Great Image, and the world will come and be beyond harm safe serene and at one. Fine food and song detain passing guests. When the Tao speaks it's senseless and plain. We look and don't see it, we listen and don't hear it, but we use it without end.",
    "What you would shorten you should therefore lengthen. What you would weaken you should therefore strengthen. What you would topple you should therefore raise. What you would take you should therefore give. This is called hiding the light. The weak conquering the strong. Fish can't survive out of the deep. A state's greatest tool is not meant to be shown.",
    "The Tao never does a thing, yet there is nothing it doesn't do. If a ruler could uphold it, people by themselves would change. And changing if their desires stirred, he could make them still with simplicity that has no name. Stilled by nameless simplicity they would not desire, and not desiring be at peace. The world would fix itself.",
    "Higher Virtue is not virtuous, thus it possesses virtue. Lower Virtue is not without virtue, thus it possesses no virtue. Higher Virtue lacks effort and the thought of effort. Higher Kindness involves effort but not the thought of effort. Higher Justice involves effort and the thought of effort. Higher Ritual involves effort but no response until it threatens and compels. When the Way is lost virtue appears. When virtue is lost kindness appears. When kindness is lost justice appears. When justice is lost ritual appears. Ritual marks the waning of belief and onset of confusion. Augury is the flower of the Way and beginning of delusion. Thus the great choose thick over thin, the fruit over the flower. Therefore they pick this over that.",
    "Of things that became one in the past - Heaven became one and was clear, Earth became one and was still, spirits became one arid were active, streams became one and were full, kings became one and ruled the world. But by implication - Heaven would crack if it were always clear, Earth would crumble if it were always still, spirits would fail if they were always active, streams would dry up if they were always full, kings would fall if they were always high and noble. Thus the noble is based on the humble, the high is founded on the low. Thus do kings refer to themselves as orphaned widowed and destitute. But is this the basis of humility, counting a carriage as no carriage at all. Not wanting to clink like jade, they clunk like rocks.",
    "The Tao moves the other way. The Tao works through weakness. The things of this world come from something. Something comes from nothing.",
    "When a great person hears of the Way he follows it with devotion. When an average person hears of the Way he doesn't know if it's real or not. When a small person hears of the Way he laughs out loud. If he didn't laugh, it wouldn't be the Way. Hence these sayings arose: the brightest path seems dark, the quickest path seems slow, the smoothest path seems rough, the highest virtue low, the whitest white pitch-black, the greatest virtue wanting, the staunchest virtue timid, the truest truth uncertain, the perfect square lacks corners, the perfect tool does nothing, the perfect sound is hushed, the perfect form is shapeless. The Tao is hidden and has no name, but because it's the Tao it knows how to start and how to finish.",
    "The Tao gives birth to one. One gives birth to two. Two gives birth to three. Three gives birth to ten thousand things. Ten thousand things with yin at their backs and yang in their embrace and breath between for harmony. What the world hates, to be orphaned widowed or destitute, kings use for their titles. Thus some gain by losing, others lose by gaining. Thus what people teach, I teach too - tyrants never choose their deaths. This becomes my teacher.",
    "The weakest thing in the world excels the strongest thing in the world. What doesn't exist finds room where there is none. Thus we know doing nothing succeeds. Teaching without words, succeeding without effort. Few in the world can equal this.",
    "Which is more vital, fame or health? Which is more precious, health or riches? Which is more harmful, loss or gain? The deeper the love, the higher the cost. The bigger the treasure, the greater the loss. Who knows contentment suffers no shame. Who knows restraint encounters no trouble and thus lives long.",
    "The greatest thing seems incomplete, yet it never wears out. The fullest thing seems empty, yet it never runs dry. The straightest thing seems crooked. The cleverest thing seems clumsy. The richest thing seems poor. Activity overcomes cold. Stillness overcomes heat. Who can be perfectly still is able to govern the world.",
    "When the Tao prevails, courier horses manure fields instead of roads. When the Tao fails, war-horses are raised on the border. No crime is worse than yielding to desire. No wrong is greater than discontent. No curse is crueler than getting what you want. The contentment of being content is true contentment indeed.",
    "Without going out his door he knows the whole world. Without looking out his window he knows the Way of Heaven. The farther people go, the less people know. Therefore the sage knows without moving, names without seeing, succeeds without trying.",
    "Those who seek learning gain every day. Those who seek the Way lose every day. They lose and they lose until they find nothing to do. Nothing to do means nothing not done. Who rules the world isn't busy. If someone is busy he can't rule the world.",
    "The sage has no mind of his own. His mind is the mind of the people. To the good he is good. To the bad he is good until they become good. To the true he is true. To the false he is true until they become true. In the world the sage withdraws, with others he merges his mind. People open their ears and eyes, the sage covers them up.",
    "Appearing means life, disappearing means death. Thirteen are the followers of life, thirteen are the followers of death, but people living to live join the land of death's thirteen. And why? Because they live to live. It's said that those who guard life well aren't injured by soldiers in battle or harmed by rhinos or tigers in the wild for rhinos have nowhere to sink their horns, tigers have nowhere to sink their claws, and soldiers have nowhere to sink their blades. And why? Because for them there is no land of death.",
    "The Way begets them, Virtue keeps them, matter shapes them, usage completes them. Thus do all things honor the Way and glorify Virtue. The honor of the Way, the glory of Virtue, are not conferred. But always so, the Way begets and keeps them, cultivates and trains them, steadies and adjusts them, nurtures and protects them. But begets without possessing, acts without presuming, and cultivates without controlling. This is called Dark Virtue.",
    "The world has a maiden, she becomes the world's mother. Who knows the mother understands the child. Who understands the child keeps the mother safe and lives without trouble. Who blocks the opening, who closes the gate lives without toil. Who unblocks the opening, who meddles in affairs lives without hope. Who sees the small has vision. Who protects the weak has strength. Who uses his light, who trusts his vision lives beyond death. This is the Hidden Immortal.",
    "Were I sufficiently wise I would follow the Great Way and only fear going astray. The Great Way is smooth but people love byways. Their palaces are spotless, their fields are overgrown, and their granaries are empty. They wear fine clothes, they carry sharp swords, they tire of food and drink, and possess more than they need. This is called robbery and robbery is not the Way.",
    "What is planted right is not uprooted. What is held right is not ripped away. Future generations worship it forever. Cultivated in the self virtue becomes real. Cultivated in the family virtue multiplies. Cultivated in the village virtue increases. Cultivated in the state virtue prospers. Cultivated in the world virtue abounds. Thus view the self through the self, view the family through the family, view the village through the village, view the state through the state, view the world through the world. How do we know what the world is like? Through this.",
    "He who contains virtue in abundance resembles a newborn child. Wasps don't sting him, beasts don't claw him, birds of prey don't carry him off. His bones are weak, his tendons are soft and yet his grip is firm. He hasn't known the union of sexes and yet his penis is stiff. So full of essence is he. He cries all day yet never gets hoarse. So full of breath is he. Who knows how to breathe endures. Who knows how to endure is wise. Who lengthens his life tempts luck. Who breathes with his will is strong, but virility means old age. This isn't the Way. What isn't the Way ends early.",
    "Those who know don't talk. Those who talk don't know. Seal the opening. Close the gate. Dull the edge. Untie the tangle. Soften the light. Join the dust. This is called the Dark Union. It can't be embraced, it can't be abandoned, it can't be helped, it can't be harmed, it can't be exalted, it can't be debased. Thus does the world exalt it.",
    "Use direction to govern a country. Use indirection to fight a war. Use inaction to rule the world. How do we know this works? The greater the prohibitions, the poorer the people. The sharper the weapons, the darker the realm. The smarter the scheme, the stranger the outcome. The finer the treasure, the thicker the thieves. Thus the sage declares: I change nothing and the people transform themselves. I stay still and the people adjust themselves. I do nothing and the people enrich themselves. I want nothing and the people simplifY themselves.",
    "Where government stands aloof the people open up. Where government steps in the people slip away. Happiness rests in misery. Misery hides in happiness. Who knows where they end? There is no direction. Direction turns into indirection. Good turns into evil. The people have been lost for a long long time. Thus the sage is an edge that doesn't cut, a point that doesn't pierce, a line that doesn't extend, a light that doesn't blind.",
    "In governing people and caring for Heaven nothing surpasses economy. Economy means planning ahead. Planning ahead means accumulating virtue. Accumulating virtue means overcoming all. Overcoming all means knowing no limit. Knowing no limit means guarding the realm. Guarding the realm's mother means living long. This means deep roots and a solid trunk. The Way of long and lasting life.",
    "Ruling a great state is like cooking a small fish. When you govern the world with the Tao spirits display no powers. Not that they display no powers, their powers do people no harm. Not that their powers do people no harm, the sage does people no harm. And neither harms the other for both rely on Virtue.",
    "The great state is a watershed. The confluence of the world, the female of the world. Through stillness the female conquers the male. In order to be still she needs to be lower. The great state that is lower governs the small state. The small state that is lower is governed by the great state. Some lower themselves to govern, some lower themselves to be governed. The great state's only desire is to unite and lead others. The small state's only desire is to join and serve others. For both to achieve their desire the greater needs to be lower.",
    "The Tao is creation's sanctuary. Treasured by the good, it keeps the bad alive. Beautiful words might be the price, noble deeds might be the gift. How can we abandon people who are bad? Thus when emperors are enthroned or ministers installed, though there be great discs of jade followed by teams of horses, they don't rival one who sits and offers up this Way. Why the ancients exalted it? Did they not proclaim: who searches thereby finds, who errs thereby escapes. Thus the world exalts it.",
    "Act without acting. Work without working. Taste without tasting. Great or small many or few, repay each wrong with virtue. Plan for the hard while it's easy. Work on the great while it's small. The hardest task in the world begins easy. The greatest goal in the world begins small. Therefore the sage never acts great. He thus achieves great things. Who quickly agrees is seldom trusted. Who makes it all easy finds it all hard. Therefore the sage makes everything hard. He thus finds nothing hard.",
    "It's easy to rule while it's peaceful. It's easy to plan before it arrives. It's easy to break while it's fragile. It's easy to disperse while it's small. Act before it exists, govern before it rebels. A giant tree grows from the tiniest shoot. A great tower rises from a basket of dirt. A thousand-mile journey begins at your feet. But to act is to fail, to control is to lose. Therefore the sage doesn't act, he thus doesn't fail. He doesn't control, he thus doesn't lose. When people pursue a task they always fail near the end. Care at the end as well as the start means an end to failure. The sage thus seeks what no one seeks. He doesn't prize hard-to-get goods. He studies what no one studies. He turns to what others pass by. To help all things be natural, he thus dares not act.",
    "The ancient masters of the Way tried not to enlighten, but to keep men in the dark. What makes the people hard to rule is knowledge. Who rules the realm with knowledge spreads evil in the realm. Who rules without knowledge spreads virtue in the realm. Who understands these two understands the universal key. Understanding the universal key, this is called Dark Virtue. Dark Virtue goes deep, goes far, goes the other way until it reaches perfect harmony.",
    "The reason the sea can govern a hundred rivers is because it has mastered being lower. Thus it can govern a hundred rivers. Thus if the sage would be above the people he should speak as if he were below them. If he would be before them he should act as if he were behind them. Thus when the sage is above the people are not burdened. When he is in front the people are not hindered. The world never wearies of pushing him forward. Because he doesn't struggle, no one can struggle against him.",
    "The world calls me great, great but useless. Because I am great I am useless. If I were of use I would have stayed small. But I possess three treasures I treasure and uphold. First is compassion, second is austerity, third is reluctance to excel. Because I am compassionate I can be valiant. Because I am austere I can be extravagant. Because I am reluctant to excel I can be chief of all tools. If I renounced compassion for valor, austerity for extravagance, reluctance for supremacy, I would die. Compassion wins every battle and outlasts every attack. What Heaven creates let compassion protect.",
    "In ancient times the perfect officer wasn't armed. The perfect warrior wasn't angry. The perfect victor wasn't hostile. The perfect commander acted humble. This is the virtue of nonaggression. This is using the strength of others. This is uniting with Heaven, which was the ancient end.",
    "In warfare there is a saying: Rather than a host, better to be a guest. Rather than advance an inch, better to retreat a foot. This means to form no column, to wear no armor, to brandish no weapon, to repulse no enemy. No fate is worse than to have no enemy. Without an enemy we would lose our treasure. Thus when opponents are evenly matched the remorseful one prevails.",
    "My words are easy to understand easy to employ, but no one can understand them no one can employ them. Words have an ancestor, deeds have a master. Because they have no understanding, people fail to understand me. Rare are they who understand me, thus am I exalted. The sage therefore wears coarse cloth and keeps his jade inside.",
    "To understand yet not understand is transcendence. Not to understand yet understand is affliction. The reason the sage is not afflicted is because he treats affliction as affliction. Hence he is not afflicted.",
    "When people no longer fear authority a greater authority will appear. Don't restrict where people dwell. Don't repress how people live. If they aren't repressed they won't protest. Thus the sage knows himself but doesn't reveal himself. He loves himself but doesn't exalt himself. Thus he picks this over that.",
    "Daring to act means death. Daring not to act means life. Of these two, one benefits, one harms. What Heaven hates, who knows the reason. The Way of Heaven wins easily without a fight, answers wisely without a word, comes quickly without a summons, plans ingeniously without a thought. The Net of Heaven is all-embracing. Its mesh is wide but nothing escapes.",
    "If people no longer fear death, why do we threaten to kill them? And if others fear death and still act perverse, and we catch and kill them, who else will dare? As long as people fear death the executioner will exist. To kill in the executioner's place is to take the carpenter's place. Who takes the carpenter's place is bound to hurt his hands.",
    "The reason the people are hungry is because those above levy so many taxes. Thus the people are hungry. The reason the people are hard to rule is because those above are so forceful. Thus the people are hard to rule. The reason the people think little of death is because those above think so much of life. Thus the people think little of death. Meanwhile those who do nothing to live are more esteemed than those who love life.",
    "When people are born they are soft and supple. When they perish they are hard and stiff. When plants shoot forth they are soft and tender. When they die they are withered and dry. Thus it is said: The hard and strong are followers of death, the soft and weak are followers of life. When an army becomes strong it suffers defeat. When a plant becomes hard it snaps. The hard and strong dwell below, the soft and weak dwell above.",
    "The Way of Heaven is like stringing a bow. Pulling down the high, lifting up the low, shortening the long, lengthening the short. The Way of Heaven takes from the long and supplements the short. Unlike the Way of Man taking from the short and giving to the long. Who can find the long and give it to the world? Only those who find the Way. Thus the sage does not presume on what he does or claim what he achieves. Thus he chooses to hide his skill.",
    "Nothing in the world is weaker than water, but against the hard and the strong nothing excels it for nothing can change it. The soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong. This is something everyone knows, but no one is able to practice. Thus the sage declares: Who accepts a country's disgrace, we call the lord of soil and grain. Who accepts a country's misfortune, we call the king of all under Heaven. Upright words sound upside down.",
    "In resolving a great dispute, a dispute is sure to remain. How can this be good? Thus the sage holds the left marker, he makes no claim on others. Thus the virtuous oversee markers, the virtueless oversee taxes. The Way of Heaven favors no one, but always helps the good.",
    "Imagine a small state with a small population. Let there be labor-saving tools that aren't used. Let people consider death and not move far. Let there be boats and carts but no reason to ride them. Let there be armor and weapons but no reason to employ them. Let people return to the use of knots and be satisfied with their food, and pleased with their clothing, and content with their homes, and happy with their customs. Let there be a state so near people hear its dogs and chickens and live out their lives without making a visit.",
    "True words aren't beautiful, beautiful words aren't true. The good aren't eloquent, the eloquent aren't good. The wise aren't learned, the learned aren't wise. The sage accumulates nothing, but the more he does for others the greater his existence. The more he gives to others the greater his abundance. The Way of Heaven is to help without harming. The Way of the sage is to act without struggling.",
