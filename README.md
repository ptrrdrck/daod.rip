## Introduction

Dao Drip is a browser application that allows a user to read several English translations of the Daodejing side by side. To start, the app selects the same random chapter from three different translations. A user's reading history, selected translations, and settings are saved locally in the broswer so they can pick up right where they left off.

## Usage

Use the "Drip" buttons to display a new random chapter.

Use the type-in field and arrow buttons to manually "View" a specific chapter (1-81).

Use the unread chapter links to view a chapter that has not been displayed for you yet. Use the "Reset" button to show all chapter links again.

Use the checkboxes to select your preferred translations and toggle their display.

Translations are displayed in a randomly shuffled order by default. Toggle this setting to have them display in a consistent order.
